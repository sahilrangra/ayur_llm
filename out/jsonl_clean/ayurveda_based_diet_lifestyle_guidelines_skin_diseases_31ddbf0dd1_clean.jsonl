The\nprogressive establishment of\nscientific Ayurveda began in the Vedic period and has defined life as a manifestation\nof\nunion of soul, mind and body those are integral and interdependent components of\nlife. Ahara (wholesome\nfood), nidra (Optimum sleep) and brahmacharya (selective Celibacy) has been given pivotal role in the\nmaintenance of health. Along with diet, dinacharya and rtucharya has been given important role in the\nmaintenance of disease. Ayurveda describes the wholesome and non-wholesome substances including diet,\nmedicines etc. and has classified them into three major categories, viz, Shamana (palliative), Kopana\n(aggravating) and Swastha Hita (conducive to health).\nHuman body develops by assimilating nutrients from food. Wholesome food is the cause for excellence in\nhealth and unwholesome is responsible for disease. Ayurveda has developed the wisdom of dietetics on the\nbasis of various natural perceptions at different levels of our sensorium. Ahara (wholesome food), Vihara\n(wholesome activities) and Aushadha (medicaments) form the cornerstone of palliative treatment.\nAnatomy and physiology of skin has been dealt in detail by Ayurveda. The diseases of skin often mirror the\nin-equilibrium of dosha in the body as skin represents the substratum upon which the quality of ahararasa,\nwhich is obtained from Ahara, is depicted upon. The ICD-10 classification of\nhuman disease lists more than\n1,000 skin or skin-related illnesses, a pattern dominated by a few conditions accounting for most of\nthe skin\ndisease burden. Despite this profound impact, skin disease continues to receive relatively little attention in the\nnational or global health debate. Collectively, skin conditions were the 4th leading cause of\nnonfatal burden\nexpressed as years lost due to disability in 2010.\nAyurveda has included skin diseases under the umbrella of\nKushta and has pointed at its multifactorial\netiology. Erroneous Diet and lifestyle have been implicated as chief factors for the onset, progression and\nrecurrence of many skin diseases. They can prevent or alter the pathogenesis and affect the prognosis of\nskin diseases in a positive or negative manner.\nThe council has taken initiative to develop user friendly guidelines for prevention of common skin diseases\nthrough dietary and lifestyle advocacies based on authentic Ayurvedic commendations to meet the needs of\nthis era. These guidelines are useful for health seekers and physicians alike."}

The skin protects the body\nfrom harmful agents such as ultraviolet light, chemical and infective organisms in the atmosphere. Skin also regulates\nbody temperature, gathers sensory inputs from the environment, stores water, fat, and vitamin D, and plays a role in\nthe immune system protecting from the disease. The epidermis is the outermost layer of\nthe skin, and protects the\nbody from the environment. The thickness of\nthe epidermis varies in different types of skin; it is only .05 mm thick on\nthe eyelids, and is 1.5 mm thick on the palms and the soles of\nthe feet. The dermis is located beneath the epidermis\nand is the thickest of\nthe three layers of\nthe skin (1.5 to 4 mm thick), making up approximately 90 percent of\nthe\nthickness of\nthe skin. The main functions of\nthe dermis are to regulate teFmperature and to supply the epidermis with\nnutrient-saturated blood. Much of\nthe body’s water supply is stored within the dermis. This layer contains most of\nthe\nskins’\nspecialized cells and structures, including lymphatic’s, blood vessels, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, collagen,\nelastin and nerve endings. The hypodermis (subcutaneous layer, or superficial fascia) lies between the dermis and\nunderlying tissues and organs. It consists of\nmostly adipose tissue and is the storage site of\nmost body fat.\nAyurveda explains twak as one among the 5 jnanendriya, attributed with the function of sensation of\ntouch and is the\nlocation (ashray sthana) of sweat channels (swedavahi strotas) and hairs (loma). Susrutha and Bhavamishra'have\nopined that twak has 7 layers, while Vagbhatta and Charaka have described 6 layers of\ntwak as tabulated below.\nTable 1: 7 layers of Twak (skin) as explained by Ayurveda.\nName of different\nLayer\nWidth\n(thickness)\nRogadhisthan\n(site of skin diseases)\nModern concept\nAvabhasini/\nUdakdhara\n1/18 vrihi\nSidhma, Padmakantaka\nEpithelial layer, horny\nlayer, Stratum\nCorneum\nLohita/Asrugdhara\n1/16 vrihi\nTilkalak, Nyachchha, Vyang\nStratum Lucidum\nShweta /tritiya\n1/12 vrihi Ajagallika\nCharma dala\nStratum granulosum\nTamra/ chaturtha\nOuter forth\n1/8 vrihi\nKushta, Kilasa\nMalphigian layer\nVedini/ panchami\n1/5 vrihi\nKushta,Visarpa\nPapillary layer\nRohini /shasthi\n1\nvrihi\nApachi, Arbuda, Slipada,\nGalganda\nReticular\nlayer\nMamsadhara\n2 vrihi\nBhagandar, Vidradhi, Arsh\nSub cutaneous tissue,\nMuscular layer.\n1"}

The\nrational Ayurveda therapy is provided through 4 fold steps involving samshamana (palliation), dosha sodhana (bio-\ncleansing procedures), nidana parivarjana (avoiding causative factors) and pathya (dietetics suitable for disease\npacification). Lifestyle or daily regimen ofan individual is equally important\nwhile ascertaining the individual vulnerability\nto disease. Elaborate description is available on personal hygiene encompassing diet and regimen during daily routine\n(Dinacharya), seasonal routine (Ritucharya) and behavioral and ethical principles (Sadvritta). Observance of\ncertain\nrules regarding suppressible and non-suppressible urges also is important for positive health.\nThe concept of\nAhara\nEvery living and non-living beings in this universe is composed of\nfive basic elements, the Pancha\nMahabhootas,\nnamely Earth (Prithvi), Water (Ap), Fire (Teja), Air (Vayu) and Ether (Akasha) the panchabhuta components of\ningested food nourishes their respective tissue elements in the body. Ahara is the best of\nall medicines and is considered\none among the three sub-pillars of\nAyurveda (thrayo-upasthamba). The ahara (food) and vihara (lifestyle) which are\ncongenial to the channels, constitution and strength of\nan individual is termed as pathya (wholesome) and that which\nis non-congenial is termed as apathya (unwholesome). The preventive and curative aspects of\nAyurveda revolve\naround the central theme of pathya ahara and vihara. Ayurveda emphasizes basic dietary guidelines in terms of\nappropriate food, combinations of food, methods of cooking, storage, eating atmosphere, hygiene and etiquette\n(ashtavidha ahara vidhi visesha ayatana) 2\nAyurvedic dietary guidelines3:\n1. Intake of\nfood at in time (Kale bhojana).\n2. Food intake as per suitability (satmya bhojana)\n3. Food intake as per the prakruthi of\nindividual (hita bhojan)\n4. Proper hygiene (suchi bhojan)\n5.

Silently (moun)\n2\nAhara matra (quantity of\nfood)\nThe food and nutritional requirement varies from person to person and depends upon the status of\nagni, sharira\nprakriti, age etc. Susruta and Vagbhata have suggested that if stomach capacity is hypothetically divided into 4\nparts on the basis of\nits filling , one should take 2 parts of solid food, 1\npart of\nliquid food and 1\npart should be\nleft empty for easy movement of\nVata4.\nSequence of food intake\nGuru, madhura and snigdha food should be taken initially during the course of\na meal followed by amla, lavana\nahara. Food which is ruksha, katu, tikta and kashaya should be taken in the last part of\nthe meal for proper\nactivation of agni, proper absorption and assimilation of\nfood. After taking food, it is advised to take rest for\nmuhurta matra (48 minutes)5\nfor proper digestion.\nAhara vidhi viseshaayatana\nTo receive the total benefits of Ahara it is also necessary to have the knowledge about” Ashta ahara\nvidhivisheshaayatana”.they are\n1. Prakriti-food should be taken considering the nature of food, such as guru (Heavy food like\nmilk, flesh), laghu (food like green gram etc which are light to digest) , seeta (food which are\ncold in potency such as milk) , ushna (food which are of hot potency like spicy food), ruksha\n(dry ness inducing food), snigda( unctuous food such as ghee, butter) and their impact on agni .\n2. Karana- It refers to modification in the food property by action of agni, water etc. dadhi is a\nsubstance which is prohibited to be used after heating.\n3. Samyoga- it denotes the combinations of food which either augment or nullify the actions of the\nindividual components.\n4. Raashi-this represents the quantum of food required to each person\n5. Desha-The dynamics and kinetics of the food consumed is dependent on the habitat of the\nindividual and also the area from where the substance has originated.\n6. Kaala- this represents time in terms of climate, phase of digestion, timing of the day, Stage\n(avastha) of disease etc.\n7. Upayoga Samstha-food should be taken as per the rules of dietetics.\n8.

Acharya Charaka\ndefines virudhahara as certain diet and its combinations, which interrupts the metabolism, which inhibits the process\nof\nformation of\ntissue and which have opposite property to that of\nthe tissue are called as ViruddhaAnna or\nincompatible diet7. Virudha can be considered as diet which are having mutually contradictory properties,\ncontradictory to tissues, diet capable of\nproducing untoward effect on the body when processed in a particular\nform or proportion or those food which may produce an unwanted effect when taken at an inappropriate time.\nAyurvedic literature has compiled almost 18 types of\nvirudha ahara and has also mentioned complications ranging\nfrom skin diseases (kushta), visarpa (erysipelas), unmada (insanity) and marana (death).\nConcept of Vihara (Lifestyle) in Ayurveda\nThe description about Dinacharya, Rtucharya, Sadvrtta and Nidra in\nAyurveda clearly depicts the importance of\na healthy regimen in the prevention and management of\nmany diseases. A\ngrowing body of scientific evidence has\ndemonstrated that lifestyle intervention is an essential component in the treatment of\nchronic disease that can be as\neffective as medication but considered to be safe without risks and side effects8\n. A lifestyle is a characteristic\nbundle of\nbehaviours that makes sense to both others and oneself in a given time and place, including social\nrelations consumption, entertainment and dress9\n.\nDinacharya (Daily regimen)\nAyurveda promotes a lifestyle that’s in harmony with nature\nIt is advisable to wake up during Brahma\nMuhurta (preferably between 4.00 a.m. to 5.30 a.m.).\nDrinking water early in the morning according to one’s capacity cleanses the body by enhancing the\nelimination of\ntoxic wastes.\nOne should attend the nature’s calls.\nThe soft brushes made out of\ntwigs ofKhadira, Karanja, Apamarga etc. Tongue should be cleaned by\na long flexible strip of\nmetal or plant twig. It not only cleanses the tongue but also stimulates appetite and\ndigestion. Mouth should also be cleaned properly.\nEyes should be cleaned with fresh water to prevent eye diseases and promote vision. Also wash eyes with\nTriphala Phanta every day.\nChewing ofbetel leaves with small pieces of\nAreca nut (kramuka) and fragrant substances like cardamom,\ncloves, refreshes the mouth and enhance digestion.\nIt is necessary to massage whole body with oil every day. Oil massage ensures softness and unctuousness\nof skin, free movement ofjoints and muscles, peripheral circulation and elimination of\nmetabolic wastes.\nRegular exercise is essential for perfect health. It builds up stamina and resistance against disease, clears\nthe channels of\nbody (Srotas) and increases the blood circulation. It enhances efficiency of\nbody organs,\npromotes appetite and digestion and prevents obesity.\nBathing improves enthusiasm, strength, sexual vigour, appetite, span of\nlife and removes sweat and other\nimpurities from the body. After bath one should wear clean clothes and smear the body with perfume.\nOne should have regular shaving, haircut, cutting of\nnails etc.\n4"}

Whole year is divided into six seasons and detailed dietetic regimen for these seasons is prescribed. In\nspring season, bitter, hot and astringent diet is advised while salty, sour and sweet food should be avoided.\nWheat, barley, honey syrup, fruits like mango, jack fruit-etc. and meat of\nforest animals is advised. In summer\nseason due to hot climate aggravation ofpitta occurs. Hence\npitta pacifying cold, liquid, sweet and oily diet is\nadvised. Excessive hot, spicy, sour salty diet should be avoided. Intake of\nrice, milk, ghee, sugar, grapes, coconut\nwater, meat of forest animals are advised. In rainy season aggravation of vata occurs, hence vata shamaka\nsweet, sour and salty food and drinks are preferred. The food should be hot, dry, fatty and easily digestible.\nPreserved rice, wheat, barley and mutton soups are advised. In pre winter and winter season Vatadosha aggravates\ndue to cold, dry, chily atmosphere hence vataghna, pittavardhaka diet is recommended. Hot, sweet, sour and\nsalty food, milk, sugarcane, rice, oils and fats are advised and in autumn season aggravation of\nPitta dosha\noccurs. Therefore, it is ideal to take ghee processed with bitter drugs; purgation, bloodletting, coolant, and light\ndiet are advised. Diets dominant in Bitter, sweet, pungent diets are advised.\nSadvritta (Ethical Regimen): Rules of good conduct\nAyurveda prescribes certain rules for maintaining healthy mind. These are principles of\nright conduct that are\napplicable to all people at all times and places. Practicing them gives balance and harmony to the mind. These are\nAlways speak the truth.\nDo not lose your temper under any circumstances.\nDo not get addicted to sensory pleasures.\nDo not harm anyone.\nAs far as possible, do not expose yourself\nto hardships.\nTry to control your passions.\nEndeavor to speak pleasant and sweet words.\nMeditate every day for tranquility of\nmind.\nObserve cleanliness in all things.\nBe patient.\nObserve self-control.\nTry to distribute knowledge, good advice and help to others.\nWhenever possible, devote your services to God, to the wise and to respectable or elderly individuals.\nBe straightforward and kind.\nAvoid irregularity in daily activities.\n5"}

Ayurveda has given prime importance to ahara and vihara in the maintenance of\nhealth\nand prevention of diseases. In the recent past the relation between diet and skin ailments is well established in\ncontemporary medicine. Ayurvedic literature has described skin diseases mainly under the spectrum of\nkushta,\nthe literary meaning of\nwhich is that which cause disfiguration.\nAyurvedic system of\nmedicine describes a wide range of etiological factors for dermatological disorders. The\netiological factors include physical, physiological, psychological, psychosocial, hereditary and Papakarma (sinful\nactivities), based on the proximity of\ncauses which are reclassified into sannikrishta (proximal cause) and viprakrishta\n(remote cause) nidana\nSannikrista Nidana (real causative factor) - Three Doshas viz. Vata, Pitta and Kapha and four Dushyas viz.\nTvak (Rasa), Rakta, Mansa and Ambu or Lasika involved in the pathogenesis of skin diseases. These seven can\nbe considered as sannikrishta nidana in kushta.\nViprakrista Nidana - These etiological factors are not involved directly in the pathogenesis, but they increase the\ndisease proneness sensitize the body to the actual causative factors (Sannikrishta Nidana), Viprakusta nidana\nwhich include kulaja factors and\njanmottara kalaja (ahara, vihara and manasika factors).\nJanmottarakalaja: The etiological factors in present life can be categorizes into three groups, Aharaja\n(diet & dietetic patterns), Viharaja (lifestyle related) and Manasika (psychological).\nKulaja Nidana: kushta is an adibalapravrtta roga which is said to arise from the day of conception by\nconjugation of sukra and artava with bijabhaga avayava dushti10. Ill effect is thought to be transmigrated\nfrom past lives (Poorva Janmakrata)\nAccording to Sushruta if\nthe person suffered from Kushtha in his previous life and if\nhe takes rebirth then he\ndevelops Kushtha in his present life also Papakarma (sinful activities) has also been implicated in the etiology of\nkushta and is also said as a samsargja vyadhi (communicable disease). The Kushtha is generally described as\nTridoshaja Vyadhi but type of\nthe Kushtha ascertained upon the predominance of\nparticular Dosha and is generally\nclassified into mahakushta and ksudra kushta.\n7"}

Aharaja nidana- food related causes\n2. Viharaja Nidana- regimen related causes\n3. Manasika Nidana- psychological causes.\n4. Visesha Nidana- an etiology that is not common in all diseases, but specifically act as hetu in this\ndisease.\n5.

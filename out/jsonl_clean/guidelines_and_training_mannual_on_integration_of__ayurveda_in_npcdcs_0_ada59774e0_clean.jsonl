The\nmain cause is the increased exposure to tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity and harmful\nuse of alcohol, as well as inadequate health care services. There are proven interventions to prevent\nnon-communicable diseases and manage them in people with early or established disease. These\ninterventions could prevent millions of early deaths from non-communicable diseases and are highly\ncost-effective, able to be implemented in resource-poor settings, and would strengthen health\nsystems, in particular primary health care.\nThis training module is meant to provide information and knowledge that is essential in the\nprevention and management of NCDs."}

These are of long duration and generally have slow progression. All age groups and all regions\nare affected by NCDs. NCDs are often associated with older age groups, but evidence shows that 16\nmillion of all deaths attributed to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) occur before the age of 701. The\nmajor Non-communicable diseases are Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and\nstroke), Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Asthma.\nChildren, adults and the elderly are all vulnerable to the risk factors that contribute to non-communicable\ndiseases. The World Health Organization's World Health Report 2002 identified tobacco use, alcohol\nconsumption, overweight, physical inactivity, stress and high fat diet as the most important risk factors for\nNCDs. An important way to reduce the burden of NCDs on global public health is by focusing on the\nimportance of lessening, preventing, detecting, and correcting modifiable risk factors and hence\ncontrolling the major modifiable risk factors associated with these diseases.\nNCD BURDEN IN INDIA2\nIn India, deaths from NCDs are projected to almost double from about 4.5 million in 1998 to 8\nmillion by the year 2020. In the year 2005, 53% of all deaths were due to NCDs and this is projected to\nincrease by 18% over the next 10 years. India leads the world presently with 35 million diabetic subjects\nand this figure is projected to increase to about 80 million by the year 2030. Approximately 20% of\nworld’s diabetic population resides in India. It has been estimated that in India more than 2.4 million\ndeaths are due to cardiovascular disease, which is approximately 25% of all the deaths, which is far greater\nthan the deaths due to infectious diseases like diarrhoea, respiratory infection and tuberculosis. In about\n15 years, India is expected to lead the world in Cardiovascular mortality. Various epidemiological studies\nin the Indian subcontinent have indicated a rising trend in the prevalence of hypertension, which ranges\nbetween 20 - 36%. Annually around 70 new cancer cases are detected for every 100, 000 populations in\nIndia and in any given year, there are almost 15 lakh cancer patients.\nNCDs AND AYURVEDA\nThe main objective of Ayurveda is to “Maintain the health of a healthy individual by prevention of disease\nand to cure the diseased ones3.” Ayurveda being the foremost life science describes ways to prevent and\nmanage lifestyle disorders. It provides proper dietary management and lifestyle advices through Dinacharya\n(daily regimen), Ritucharya (seasonal regimen), Panchakarma (Bio-purification therapies), and Rasayana\n(rejuvenation) therapies. The Sadvritta (ideal routines) and Aachara Rasayana (code of conduct) are of\nutmost importance to maintain a healthy and happy socio-psychological well being of a person.\n1 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs355/en/ on 15-12-2015\n2 http://ncd.in/need.html on 15-12-2015\n3 Agnivesha’s Charaka Samhita, Sutrasthana."}

In this endeavour, Ayurveda, the age\nold indigenous system of health care that primarily focuses on prevention of diseases through life style\nmodifications and interventions (based on the fundamental concepts) can play an important role in\nprevention, control and treatment of NCDs (Diabetes and its complications, Hypertension) and\nmanagement of risk factors like High lipid levels etc. As per the NPCDCS programme, Integration of\nAYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha & Homoeopathy) for prevention and health promotion is one\nof its mandate.\nMoreover, integration of Ayurveda can also provide cost-effective management of NCDs, as these\nconditions require lifelong management and strengthen the primary healthcare network in order to ensure\nthe success of its action plan.\n4 A Guide for Health workers, Developed for NPCDCS Programme Dte.GHS, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Govt. of India"}

Patients with high blood sugar levels typically\nexperience frequent urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), excessive hunger (polyphagia) and\nexhaustion.\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nIn 2000, India (31.7 million) followed by China (20.8 million) topped the world with the highest\nnumber of people with Diabetes mellitus. Its prevalence is predicted to double globally from 171 million\nin 2000 to 366 million in 2030 with a maximum increase in India to an extent that by 2030 Diabetes\nmellitus may afflict up to 79.4 million individuals in India.5\nTYPES\nDiabetes is due to either the Pancreas not producing enough insulin or the cells of the body not\nresponding properly to the insulin produced. There are three main types of Diabetes mellitus:\nType 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) results from the pancreas failure to produce enough insulin. This\nform was previously referred to as \"Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus\" (IDDM) or \"juvenile\ndiabetes\". The cause is unknown.\nType 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is the commonest type of Diabetes which occurs usually after\nthirties. It begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly.\nAs the disease progresses a lack of insulin may also develop. This form was previously referred to as\n\"Non Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus\" (NIDDM) or \"Adult-onset Diabetes\". Type 2 diabetes is\ndue primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics. The primary cause is excessive body weight and not\nenough exercise.\nGestational Diabetes (GD) mellitus resembles type 2 diabetes in several respects, but occurs during\npregnancy. It occurs in about 2–10% of all pregnancies and may improve or disappear after delivery.\nHowever, after pregnancy approximately 5–10% of women suffering from Gestational diabetes are\nfound to have Diabetes mellitus, most commonly type 2. Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but\nrequires careful medical supervision throughout the pregnancy. Management may include dietary\nchanges, blood glucose monitoring, and in some cases insulin may be required.\nPre-diabetes indicates a condition that occurs when a person's blood glucose levels are higher than\nnormal but not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 DM.\n5 Seema Abhijeet Kaveeshwar and Jon Cornwall; The current state of diabetes mellitus in India; Australasian Medical Journal 2014; 7(1): 45–48."}

It is also called High blood pressure. Blood pressure may be different at different times of the day.\nIt is usually higher when individuals first wake up, after exercise, or under stress. Having higher blood\npressure for short intervals of time is normal. However, when blood pressure stays high for a longer\nduration, it can cause serious health problems. It can strain the heart, damage blood vessels, and increases\nthe risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney problems, and even lead to death.\nEPIDEMIOLOGY OF HYPERTENSION\nHypertension (HTN) exerts a substantial public health burden on cardiovascular health status and\nhealthcare systems in India. HTN is directly responsible for 57% of all stroke deaths and 24% of all\ncoronary heart disease (CHD) deaths in India18.\nIn an analysis of worldwide data for the global burden of HTN, 20.6% of Indian men and 20.9% of\nIndian women were suffering from HTN in 2005. The rates for HTN in percentage are projected to go up\nto 22.9 and 23.6 for Indian men and women, respectively by 2025. Recent studies from India have shown\nthe prevalence of HTN to be 25% in urban and 10% in rural people in India.19\nTYPES OF HYPERTENSION\nBased on the etiology, high blood pressure is classified as either primary (essential) hypertension or\nsecondary hypertension.\nPrimary/Essential Hypertension\nPrimary or “essential” hypertension has no known cause, however many of the lifestyle factors contribute\nto this condition. About 90–95% of cases of hypertension are categorized as primary hypertension with\nno obvious underlying cause.\nSecondary Hypertension\nSecondary hypertension is caused by some other medical conditions/problems or the use of certain\nmedications. Incidence of Secondary hypertension is comparatively very low. The causes of secondary\nhypertension include:\n• Kidney diseases (Reno-vascular disease and Chronic renal disease etc.) are the most common\nsecondary cause of Hypertension.\n• Endocrine\ndisorders:\nHyperthyroidism,\nCushing’s\nsyndrome,\nPheochromocytoma,\nhyperaldosteronism, hyperparathyroidism\n• Coarctation of the aorta\n• Pregnancy, Use of contraceptive pills etc.\n17 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0024201/\n18 Gupta R;Trends in hypertension epidemiology in India; J Hum Hypertens. 2004 Feb;18(2):73-8\n19 Debaprasad Chakrabarti et. al.;Prevalence, Awareness and Control of Hypertension in Rural Population of Tripura Journal of Evidence\nBased Medicine & Healthcare Vol. 2;Issue 50; Nov. 2015; Page: 8575-8578"}

Dyslipidemia is widely regarded as a major risk factor for Coronary Heart\nDisease (CHD) and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD); for every 1% increase in\ncholesterol level there is 1-2% increase in the incidence of CHD.35\n35 ijapr.in/articles/research/fulltext/2714136.pdf"}

The carcinogenic agents that people\nbreathe, eat, drink and are otherwise exposed to, largely determine the occurrence of the disease. The\ncommon causative factors include tobacco use, being overweight or obese, unhealthy diet with low fruit\nand vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, alcohol use, sexually transmitted HPV-infection, infection\nby HBV, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, urban air pollution, smoke (indoor or industrial) etc.\nTobacco use is the single most important risk factor for cancer causing about 20% of global cancer deaths\nand around 70% of global lung cancer deaths.45\nThe high rates of cervical and breast cancers have created a higher cancer burden in women than\nmen and hence these diseases are of major societal and familial consequence.\nProbable Signs for early detection of Cancer (CAUTION):\n• Change in bowel or bladder habits\n• A sore that does not heal\n• Unusual bleeding or discharge\n• Thickening or lump in the breast or elsewhere\n• Indigestion or difficulty in swallowing\n• Obvious change in a wart or mole\n• Nagging cough or hoarseness of voice\nCancer can be treated successfully if detected early. Screening is a means of early detection of the\ndisease in asymptomatic individuals with the goal of decreasing morbidity and mortality. Screening can\npotentially save lives as shown in cervical, and breast cancer. Public education on the avoidance of\nidentified risk factors for cancer and encouraging healthy habits contributes to its prevention and\ncontrol.46\nThe social origin of lifestyle must also be considered in cancer prevention. It is now known that over\none-third of cancers are preventable, and one-third potentially curable provided they are diagnosed early\nin their course. The quality of life of patients with incurable disease can be improved with palliative care.47\nGeneral measures for prevention of Cancer\n• Stop using tobacco in all forms\n• Avoid consuming alcohol\n• Adopt healthy food habits\n• Choose predominantly plant based diets rich in fruits and vegetables\n• Restrict the intake of red-meat (beef, pork etc.) and preserved meat\n• Engage in regular physical activity\n• Maintain optimum weight for height and age\n45 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/\n46 Oncology and Hematology (Part 6), Prevention and Early Detection of Cancer, Education and Healthful habits, Harrison’s Principles of\nInternal Medicine, 17th Edition, Vol. I, Year 2008, pg.486.\n47 M.

These along with many other types are also associated with Cervical Intraepithelial\nNeoplasia (CIN).55\n52 http://www.breastcancerindia.net/statistics/stat_global.html\n53 Oncology and Hematology (Part 6), Breast cancer, Evaluation Breast masses in Men and Women, The Palpable Breast Mass, Harrison’s\nPrinciples of Internal Medicine, 17th Edition, Vol. I, Year 2008, pg. 564.\n54 Oncology and Hematology (Part 6), Breast cancer, Evaluation Breast masses in Men and Women, The Palpable Breast Mass, Harrison’s\nPrinciples of Internal Medicine, 17th Edition, Vol. I, Year 2008, pg.564.\n55 Oncology and Hematology (Part 6), Gynecologic Malignancies, Cervix Cancer, Etiology and Genetics, Harrison’s Principles of Internal\nMedicine, 17th Edition, Vol. I, Year 2008, pg.608."}

Cervical cancer is on the\ndeclining trend in India according to the population-based registries; yet it continues to be a major public\nhealth problem for women in India. The epidemiological risk factors are early age at marriage, multiple\nsexual partners, multiple pregnancies, poor genital hygiene, malnutrition, use of oral contraceptives, and\nlack of awareness56.\nSymptoms57\nPatients with Cervical cancer are generally asymptomatic, and the disease is detected on routine pelvic\nexamination.\n• Abnormal bleeding or post coital spotting that may increase to inter-menstrual or prominent\nmenstrual bleeding\n• Feeling of any mass per vaginum\n• Yellowish vaginal discharge\n• Lumbo-sacral back pain\n• Lower extremity edema\n• Urinary symptoms\nScreening strategy\nIn developed countries, screening for precancerous and cancerous cells using Pap tests has\nreduced cervical cancer development and death by 80%. However, in India and other developing\ncountries, screening examinations like Pap tests and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing is not\npossible for most women, especially those living in rural areas, because of the cost, the need for a\nlaboratory to get results, and a lack of trained health care workers.\n• Pap smear test- The Pap smear is 90-95 % accurate in detecting early lesions such as Cervical\nIntraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) but is less sensitive in detecting cancer when frankly invasive\ncancer or fungating masses are present. Inflammation, necrosis and haemorrhage may produce\nfalse –positive smears, and colposcopic-directed biopsy is required when any lesion is visible on\nthe cervix, regardless of Pap smear findings.58\n• Visual Inspection with Acetic acid (VIA) test- The VIA test is performed by applying vinegar\nto the cervix using a cotton swab. After 60 seconds, the cervix is examined with the naked eye\nusing a lamp. Precancerous tissue turns white when vinegar is applied, while healthy tissue does\nnot change color. The results are known immediately, and the test can be done by primary health\ncare workers.59\nDiagnostic tests60\n• Colposcopic-directed Biopsy is a technique using a binocular microscope and 3% acetic acid\napplied to the cervix in which abnormal areas appear white and can be biopsied directly.\n56 Aswathy Sreedevi et.al.

RHD is the most common cardiovascular disease in children\nand young adults. If the damaged heart valves are not repaired or replaced by cardiac surgery, the\ncondition may become fatal.\nEpidemiology\nRHD affects more than 1.5 crore people worldwide and causes over 2.3 lakh deaths per year. India\ncontributes to about 25% to 50% of newly diagnosed cases of RHD of the world. The Indian Council of\nMedical Research (ICMR) had conducted school surveys in several parts of the country at different points\nof time; the data obtained from these studies shows decline in RHD prevalence in many States. The\nprevalence of RHD is estimated at 0.9 per 1000 children in the age-group of 5-14 years by the study.\nHowever, the prevalence of RHD in some parts of the country still remains high.\nRHD is widespread in low-income and overcrowded communities, where there is lack of hygiene\nand sanitation. RF and RHD have been nearly eradicated in developed countries, probably because of\nbetter living conditions, and better access to health care facilities.\nPathogenesis\nRheumatic Fever follows untreated infection with a bacterium called “Group- A Beta Hemolytic\nStreptococcus”. Repeated episodes of Rheumatic Fever lead to worsening damage to the heart valves and\ntherefore early diagnosis of RHD is very important.\nDiagnosis\n1. Diagnosis of Streptococcal pharyngitis\nSymptoms of Streptococcal pharyngitis include pain in throat and difficulty in swallowing, usually\nassociated with high fever and hoarseness of voice. These symptoms last for more than a week. Clinical\nexamination reveals pus points over tonsils and swollen cervical lymph nodes.\nThe final confirmation is however by throat swab culture positive for Group- A Streptococcus,\nhigh or rising Anti-Streptolysin O titre, etc.\n2. Diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever\nRheumatic Fever has very typical signs and symptoms. RF must be suspected in any child\npresenting with pain and swelling in large joints with or without fever, and with history of bacterial sore\nthroat in the recent past. Symptoms of breathlessness, palpitations, chest pain may accompany and are\nindicative of carditis due to Rheumatic Fever.\nDiagnosis of Rheumatic Fever is conventionally made using ‘modified Jones criteria’, which is a set\nof guidelines to aid clinicians. The Major and Minor criteria are as given in the table below:\nMajor criteria\nMinor criteria\nCarditis: Clinical and/or Subclinical*\nMonoarthralgia\nArthritis:\n• Monoarthritis or polyarthritis\n• Polyarthralgia\nFever (≥38°C)\nChorea\nESR ≥30 mm/h and/or CRP ≥3.0 mg/dl\nErythema marginatum\nProlonged PR interval, after accounting for age variability (unless carditis is a major\ncriterion)\nSubcutaneous nodules\n*Subclinical carditis indicates echocardiographic valvulitis.\nCRP: C-Reactive Protein; ESR: Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate"}

This could be in the form of\npositive throat culture for Group- A Streptococcus, high or rising anti-streptolysin O titre or other\nStreptococcal antibodies (anti-DNASE B).\n• For diagnosing first episode of RF:\no Two Major criteria or,\no One Major plus two Minor criteria\n• For diagnosing recurrence of RF:\no Two Major criteria or,\no One Major plus two Minor criteria or,\no Three Minor criteria\n3. Diagnosis of Rheumatic Heart Disease:\n• History and physical examination are quite typical and therefore clinical diagnosis of RHD is generally\nquite obvious. Common symptoms of RHD include breathlessness on exertion, tiredness, swelling of\nfeet. Patients with severe valve disease may present with orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea\nand heart failure. Cardiac murmurs are hallmark of RHD.\n• The investigations like X-ray chest, ECG and Echocardiography further help to determine severity of\nthe valve damage.\nTreatment and Prevention\nRHD can be prevented by prevention and management of Streptococcal pharyngitis and Rheumatic\nFever.\nStreptococcus bacteria can easily spread from person to person as it is highly contagious. The bacteria\nspread to other people through coughing and sneezing, by not washing one’s hands, lack of hygiene, etc.\nTherefore, it is important to understand that RF can be prevented by treating streptococcal infections.\nPrimary prevention:\nPrimary prevention of RF (the prevention of initial attack) is recommended by treating the streptococcal\nthroat infections by administering a single intramuscular injection of long acting Penicillin (Benzathine\nPenicillin) or by oral antibiotic (usually Penicillin) for a period of 10 days.\nSecondary Prevention:\nPatients who develop one episode of RF following a streptococcal sore throat are at a much higher risk\nfor developing further episodes of RF, if they develop recurrent throat infections. They need to receive\npreventive treatment with Penicillin injection for longer durations, so that RF does not recur. This is called\nas secondary prophylaxis. Secondary prophylaxis is recommended for all people who have a history of RF\nor RHD."}

Public health measures such as proving information and education help to avert the disease\nitself and benefit and protect the entire population. Different stakeholders, therefore, need to be oriented\ntowards various prevention methods and approaches to reduce the burden of these diseases.\nIt is important that primary prevention strategies should be targeted from childhood, preferably involving\nhealth education programmes at school levels. It should aim at promoting healthy diets, exercise and\navoiding the use of tobacco & alcohol. Further, the primary prevention strategies may be complemented\nby basic provisions like availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in nearby areas, facilities for Physical\nactivity/exercise and making the village or city smoke free etc.\n\"Integration\" is the act of combining or adding various parts to make a unified approach.

He/ She should not be\nmoving or speaking.\n The arm must be supported at the level of the heart. Ensure no tight clothing constricts the arm.\n Place the cuff on at least 80% of the arm (but not more than 100%) on the upper left portion of arm\nneatly with the centre of the bladder over the brachial artery. The bladder should encircle the arm.\n The column of mercury must be vertical, and at the observers eyes level.\n Rest the arm of the person on table so that the elbow of the person is parallel to heart. Wrap the\nblood pressure cuff around the arm slightly above the crease of forearm. Place the stethoscope on the\ncrease of the forearm and pump the blood pressure cuff up to 200. The metal attachment on the side\nof the pump allows you to inflate and deflate the cuff.\n Estimate the systolic pressure by palpatory method:\n• Palpate the radial / brachial artery\n• Inflate cuff until pulsation disappears\n• Deflate cuff\n• Estimate systolic pressure\n As you deflate the cuff, you will hear sounds (Korotkoff sounds) of different intensity. The first\nappearance of faint, repetitive, clear tapping sounds, which gradually increase in intensity, measures\nthe systolic blood pressure. The point at which all sounds finally disappear completely is the diastolic\npressure.\n The blood pressure should be recorded as soon as it is measured.\n Normal blood pressure is 120/80 mm of Hg."}

BMI is a fairly reliable\nindicator of body fatness for most people.\nHeight & Weight measurement procedure\nThe person should be asked to remove as much outerwear as possible and as per convenience. Regardless\nof the clothing worn, the person should be asked to remove his/her shoes/footwear. Additionally, the\nperson will be asked to empty his/her pockets and other objects like eyeglasses, mobile, keys, pocket\ndiaries, wallet etc., if possible, so that accurate height and weight measurements can be obtained.\nMethod for measurement of Weight\n• The person should be asked to step up backwards onto the weighing machine and stand still over the\ncenter of the scale with body weight evenly distributed between both feet. In order to ensure\nconfidentiality and to prevent the person from seeing his/her weight, it is required that the person\nstep on the scale backward facing away from the readout.\n• The person’s arms should be hanging freely by the sides of the body, with palms facing the thighs.\n• The person should hold his/her head up, and face forward.\n• The reading on the weighing machine should be observed and recorded.\nMethod for measurement of Height\n• The person should be asked to stand with his/her back against the board/wall. The back, scapulae and\nbuttocks are in contact with the vertical board/wall if possible, or whichever part of the body touches\nthe board first. The weight of the person should be evenly distributed on both feet.\n• The person should be asked to place the legs together, bringing the ankles or knees together,\nwhichever comes together first (often they will come together simultaneously).\n• The person is instructed to stand erect (stand up straight and look straight ahead).\n• The person’s position should be verified from both the FRONT and from the LEFT side of the body.\n• The person’s head is positioned in the Frankfort Horizontal Plane. In this position, an imaginary line\ncan be drawn from the bottom of the eye socket (orbital margin) to the external opening of the ear\n(external auditory canal).\n• The person should be asked to inhale deeply and hold his/her breath while maintaining the head and\nbody in the same position. Sometimes a person will either lift his/her head or pull up onto the toes"}

Sometimes a person will either lift his/her head or pull up onto the toes\n53\nwhen taking the deep breath. If this happens, the measurer will need to re-position the body and head\nbefore taking the measurement.\n• The height measured should be recorded.\nWhat is Waist Circumference (WC)?\nWaist Circumference (WC) is an indirect measure of abdominal fat in the body. Waist can be measured\nusing a non-stretchable fibre measure tape with the participant standing erect in a relaxed position with\nboth feet together and looking straight.\nWaist circumference measurement technique\nAccurate measurement of waist circumference is achieved using the\nfollowing technique:\n• Ensure that the patient is standing erect and has relaxed the\nabdominal muscles. Measurement is taken at the end of normal\nexpiration.\n• Locate the top of the hip bone (iliac crest) and take the measurement\njust above this bony landmark, just where one finger can fit between\nthe iliac crest and the lowest rib.\n• Ensure that the tape measure is positioned horizontally, parallel to\nthe floor.\n• Measuring at a level just above the iliac crest, and positioning the tape horizontally, irrespective of\nwhether the umbilicus is above or below the tape, provides the correct waist circumference\nmeasurement and should correspond to the maximal abdominal diameter.\n• Tape should not be too tight or do not make compressions in the skin while measuring the waist.\n• When measuring waist circumference it is important not to be tempted to measure around the\nnarrower part of the abdomen situated below the umbilicus. Using the anatomical landmark of the\niliac crest and ensuring that measurement is taken on a horizontal plane just above this level provides\nthe most accurate, reliable and reproducible technique for waist circumference measurement."}

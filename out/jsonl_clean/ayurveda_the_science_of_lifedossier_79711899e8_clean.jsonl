Initially it was\ndeveloped through ancient wisdom, clinical experiences and experimentation in scientific\nmanner. At present, Ayurveda is growing in the paradigm of contemporary scientific,\ntechnological and medical parameters.\nThe term ‘Ayurveda’ meaning ‘the knowledge of life’ comprises of two Sanskrit words viz.\n‘A yu’ meaning ‘Life’ and ‘Veda’ meaning ‘Knowledge’ or ‘Science’. The earliest concepts\nof medical science are found in the ancient wisdom called Veda, which were believed to be\ncomposed between 5000 - 1000 BC. The classical texts of Ayurveda containing exclusive\ninformation on health and disease came around 1000 B.C. onwards, when fundamental and\napplied principles of Ayurveda were codified in a systematic manner. The basic tenets of\nAyurveda are elaborated in two great medical compendia viz. Caraka Samhita and Susruta\nSamhita. Since its advent, Ayurveda passed through different political and socio cultural\nphases and stood test of time, got enriched by the contribution of different practitioners and\nscholars and catered the health needs of contemporary societies. Present form of Ayurveda is\nthe outcome of continued scientific inputs that have gone into the evolution of its principles,\ntheories and guidelines of healthy living and disease management.\nAt present, Ayurveda has become integral part of national health delivery system of India.\nAyurveda institutions for research and education, hospitals and dispensaries were established\nin different parts of the country. The government had initiated measures to regulate the\nsystem. In 1971, Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) was set up as statutory body to\nregulate education and practice. For undertaking integrated and coordinated research,\nComposite Drug Research Scheme (CDRS) was initiated in 1964. In 1970, Central Council\nfor Research in Indian Medicine & Homoeopathy (CCRIMH) was established for giving\nfocused attention towards research. A separate Department of Indian Systems of Medicine\nand Homoeopathy (ISM&H) under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of\nIndia was created in 1995 for developing Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and\nHomoeopathy systems. This department was renamed as Department of Ayurveda, Yoga &\nNaturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) in 2003. Research activities in\nAyurveda have increased manifold with establishment of separate and autonomous research\ncouncil viz. Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS).\nEducation, clinical practice, manufacturing and sale of Ayurvedic medicines are regulated in\nthe country through Acts, Rules and Regulations.

Infrastructure development in private and\npublic sectors has improved the outreach of Ayurveda to the community in a commendable\nway. Global resurgence of demand for natural medicine has filliped R&D activities in\nXV\nAyurveda at national and international levels with inter-disciplinary collaboration and\nlinkages.\nGovernment of India has enunciated “National Policy on Indian Systems of Medicine &\nHomoeopathy - 2002”.\nThe policy inter alia includes the strategy for comprehensive\ndevelopment of Ayurveda in contemporary perspective.\nThe Department of AYUSH has supported several international conferences/seminars/\nworkshops/trade fairs in collaboration with Indian Missions, Universities, Associations and\nother agencies promoting traditional systems of medicine overseas. AYUSH experts are\nfrequently deputed as resource persons to such events and also for facilitating Continuing\nMedical Education (CME) and training programs on AYUSH systems in foreign universities.\nChairs on Ayurveda are being set up in the Universities in Germany and South Africa. Under the\nDepartment's International Cooperation scheme the department of AYUSH has set up an\nAYUSH information cell in the premises of the Indian cultural centre in Malaysia with the\nsupport of\nIndian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. India is a prominent member\nin the Inter-governmental Committee (IGC) on Traditional Knowledge, Genetic Resources and\nFolklore.\nGood health is a basic prerequisite to acquire materialistic, social and spiritual upliftment of\nindividual. Therefore Ayurveda lays great emphasis on preservation and promotion of health\nand prevention of disease. This is achieved through life style management rather than drug or\nany other external intervention. According to Ayurveda, the living human body is a\ncomposition of the body matrix, Indriya (sensory and motor organs), Manas (mind) and\nAtma (soul). Ayurveda advocates a holistic approach while understanding healthy and\ndiseased states of the human body, and their management. In this respect the human body is\nconsidered a microcosm representing the Universe, a macrocosm. The universe as well as the\nhuman body is made up of ‘Pahcamahabhuta’, the five basic elements viz. ‘Prthvi, the\nbasic earthy/gross element, ‘/a/a’, the basic aqueous element, ‘Agni’, the basic thermal\nelement, ‘Vayu’, the basic gaseous element and ‘Akasa’, the basic ethereal element.\nSimilarly the Moon, Sun and Wind in the Universe are represented in the human body\nrespectively by three ‘Dosa ’ (regulatory and functional entities of the body) viz. ‘Kapha ’,\n‘Pitta’ and ‘V a y u These ‘Dosa’ are regulatory and functional entities of the body. Any\nfunction in the body is grossly attributed to one of the three ‘Dosa \\\nThe structural entities in the body are classified as ‘Dhatu ’. They are seven in number and\nare responsible for maintaining the body in a compact and composed state. The seven\n‘Dhatu ’ are i. ‘Rasa ’ (nutrient fluids), ii. ‘Rakta ’ (blood), iii. ‘Mamsa ’ (muscle tissue), iv.\nXVI"}

The excretions from eyes, ear etc. are also categorized as\n‘Mala \\\nApart from ‘Dosa’, ‘Dhatu9\nand ‘Mala’ the living body harbors an independent mechanism\nof digestion and metabolism. The digestion and metabolism is function of ‘Agni’, which is a\ncomposite mechanism in various parts of the body. Ayurveda defines health as a state of\nequilibrium of ‘Dosa’\n, ‘\nDhatu’\n, ‘\nMala’ and ‘\nAgni’. Loss of this equilibrium invariably\nresults into manifestation of disease.\nEvery individual has a unique ‘Prakrti’ (psychosomatic constitution) which is responsible for\nthe structural and functional attributes of body and mind, health or disease patterns of an\nindividual. The basic constitution of a person is determined at the time of conception.\nAyurvedic concept of examination of ‘Prakrti’ is a key determinant for prescribing\nindividualized diet, lifestyle or treatment regimen.\nThe disease management in Ayurveda is considered under two major heads 1. Nidana\n(diagnosis) and 2. Cikitsa (treatment). Ayurvedic method of diagnosis involves Rogi Parlksa\n(clinical examination) as well as the Roga Parlksa (diagnosis of disease). The diagnosis is\nprincipally based on evaluating the status of Dosa', Dhatu', ’\nMala’\nand Agni', whereas\ntreatment modules are designed principally with an object of restoring their equilibrium. The\nAyurvedic treatment methods can be grossly divided into three methods 'Samsodhana'\n(bio-cleansing therapy), 'Samsamana' (palliative therapy) and 'Nidana Parivaijana’\n(avoidance\nof causative factors). 'Samsodhana' is practiced through one or more therapies from\n'Panchakarma', whereas 'Samsamana'\nis achieved through 'Ahara ' (food),' Vihara ' (lifestyle) and\n'Dravya’{\ndrug).\nAyurveda believes that no substance in the Universe is devoid of therapeutic potential,\nprovided it is used judiciously. Plants, Minerals, Metals and Animal products serve as a\nbasic source of Ayurvedic drugs. Drugs prepared from plants are known as ‘Kasthausadhi ’\nwhereas mineral and metal drugs are known as ‘Rasausadhi’. Animal products are not\nfrequently used as independent drugs; however they are used as a medium or vehicle in\npreparation or administration of plant and mineral/metal drugs.

Plant drugs are used in different dosage forms in accordance with subject\nspecific requirement. The basic dosage forms of plant drugs are known as ‘\nPancavidha\nKasaya Kalpana’ (five dosage forms). They are ‘Svarasa’ (expressed juice), ‘Kalka’ (paste),\n‘Kvatha’ (decoction), ‘Phanta’ (hot infusion) and ‘Hima’ (cold infusion). Many more\ndosage forms such as ‘Curna ’ (powder), ‘ Vati ’ (pill), Asava- Arista (medicated fermented\npreparations), ‘Lehya ’ (linctus), aqueous extracts etc. derived with modem technology are\nalso in practice. The methods of preparation of these dosage forms are fairly simple, because\nof which the Ayurvedic practitioners prefer to prepare the required drugs on their own.\nHowever preparation of ‘Rasausadhi ’ (mineral and metal drugs) is a complicated procedure.\nMinerals and metals are generally known to be potentially harmful to the human body if not\nprocessed properly. These minerals and metals are subjected to complex and meticulous\nprocessing to make them therapeutically useful and safe to the body in prescribed doses. The\nfinal product of mineral/metal drugs made with incineration generally known as ‘Bhasma ’\n(calcined material) and others as ‘Rasausadhi’.\nAyurvedic drugs are being manufactured on large scale by approximately 8000 Ayurvedic\ndrug manufacturing units spread all over the country. According to Drugs and Cosmetics Act\n1940, Ayurvedic drugs are classified into two categories - i. Classical or generic drug\nformulations manufactured exclusively in accordance with the formulae described in the\nspecified authoritative books of Ayurveda and ii. Patent and Proprietary drug formulations\ndeveloped by the manufacturer. The demand for medicinal plants has increased manifold due\nto upsurge in domestic Ayurvedic drug industry and global interest in herbal products. The\nGovernment of India has set up National Medicinal Plants Board with the object to promote\ncultivation and propagation of medicinal plants and also to ensure sustained supply of quality\nplant material to Ayurvedic drug industry.\nManufacturing, sale and distribution of Ayurvedic drugs are regulated through Drugs and\nCosmetic Act 1940 and Drugs and Cosmetics Rules 1945. The Government of India has set\nup the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia Committee (APC) to prescribe standards of single drugs\nand compound formulations mentioned in Ayurveda for the use of manufacturers. Moreover\nGood Manufacturing Practices (GMP) under Schedule ‘T’ of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act\n1940, have also been notified to ensure the quality of ASU (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani)\nmedicines.

According to Indian\nphilosophy, health is prerequisite to pursue materialistic, social and spiritual upliftment of\nhuman being. It is believed that Lord Brahma the creator of the universe was also the first\npreacher of Ayurveda. Four Vedas, considered as oldest Indian literatures composed between\n5000 and 1000 BC have information on treatment by plants and natural procedures. Reference\nof medicine and surgery are also found in Indian epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. How\never, Ayurveda was established as a fully grown medical system from the period of Samhita\n(compendium) i.e. around 1000 BC. The compendia like Caraka Samhita and Susruta\nSamhita were written in a systematic manner with eight specialties during this period. In these\ntreatises, the basic tenets and therapeutic techniques of Ayurveda got very much organized and\nenunciated.\nThese treatises stressed the importance of maintenance of health and also\nexpanded their vision to pharmaco-therapeutics. The therapeutic properties of plants, animal\nproducts and minerals were extensively described in these compendia, which has made\nAyurveda a comprehensive system of health care.\nThere were two main schools of thoughts in Ayurveda; Punarvasu Atreya - the school of\nphysicians and Divodasa Dhanvantari- the school of surgeons. Punarvasu Atreya is mentioned\nas a pioneer in medicine, and Divodasa Dhanvantari in surgery. Disciples belonging to each\nschool immensely contributed in development of the traditions of their own school. Six pupils\nof Atreya are believed to have composed their own compendia based on their Guru's\nteachings, but only two namely Bhela Samhita in its original form and Agnivesa\ntantra redacted by Caraka and Dridhabala are available today. Considered to be the most\nancient and authoritative writing on Ayurveda available today, Caraka Samhita explains the\nlogic and philosophy on which this system of medicine is based. Dhanvantari had six disciples\nand Susruta Samhita, a treatise primarily focusing on surgery was codified by Susruta on\nthe basis of teachings of Dhanvantari.\n1"}

Thus, the main three treatises called Brhattrayi i.e.\nCaraka Samhita, Susruta Samhita and Astanga Sangraha formed basis for subsequent scholars\n_\n_\n_\n/\n_\nto write texts and among them three concise classics i.e. Madhava Nidana, Sarngadhara\nSamhita and Bhava Prakasa having distinct features are called as Laghutrayi. Some other\neminent practitioners and visionaries like Kasyapa, Bhela, and Harita also wrote their\nrespective compendia.\nAn analysis of Ayurvedic treatises signifies that the different aspects of Ayurveda were\nevolved and documented from time to time in the form of texts or compendia. For instance the\nCaraka Samhita an authentic source of internal medicine emphasizes on philosophy of life and\nline of treatment for different diseases. Susruta Samhita added a complete systematic\napproach to surgery and diseases of eyes, ear, throat, nose, head and dentistry.\nMadhava Nidana, authored by Madhavakara is a work on diagnosis of the diseases.\nBhava Prakasa written by Bhava Misra gives additional emphasis on medicinal plants and\nr\nDiet. Sarngadhara Samhita focused on pharmaceutics and Ayurveda was enriched with\naddition of more formulations and dosage forms. Subsequently, texts of Ayurveda were\ncommented upon, updated and methodically written by many authors from time to time.\nA look into commentaries on the treatises by the scholars indicates that while the theoretical\nframework of Ayurveda remained more or less the same, the knowledge about drugs and\ntechniques of therapy got expanded. The old concepts and descriptions were reviewed and\nupdated in the light of contemporary understanding by the commentators in their\ncommentaries thus reviving Ayurveda into an applied form. Present form of Ayurveda is the\noutcome of continued scientific inputs that has gone into the evolution of its principles,\ntheories and practices.\nDuring Buddhist period Jivaka, a famous surgeon who treated Gautam Buddha studied\nAyurveda at Takshashila University. Around 200 BC, medical students from different parts of\nthe world used to come to the ancient University of Takshashila to learn Ayurveda.

Greeks and Romans came to know about it after their\ninvasion. In the early part of the first millennium Ayurveda spread to the East\nthrough Buddhism and greatly influenced the Tibetan and Chinese system of medicine and\nherbology.\nAround 800 AD, Nagaijuna has conducted extensive studies on medicinal applications of\nmercury and other metals. These studies have entailed in the emergence of a new branch of\nAyurveda viz. Rasa Sastra. Rigorous procedures were developed to purify, detoxify and\nprocess formulations with metallic ingredients by using plant and animal materials. Classical\ntreatises named Rasaratnasamuccaya, Rasarnava, Rasa Hrdaya Tantra elaborating the\nmanufacture of mineral and metallic drugs and their use in therapeutics were written during\nthis period. Ayurveda, in later periods used Mercury as well as other metals as important\ncomponents of pharmaceutical formulations. Many exotic and indigenous drugs for new uses\nth.\nfound place in Ayurvedic literature. After 16\nCentury, there have been inclusions of\ndiagnosis and treatment of new diseases on the basis of modem medical science.\nIn 1827, the first Ayurveda course was started in India in the Government Sanskrit College,\nCalcutta. By the beginning of 20th\nCentury, many Ayurveda colleges were established in India\nunder the patronage of provincial Rulers. Ayurveda gained more ground beginning from the\n1970, as a gradual recognition of the value of Ayurveda revived. Lots of academic work was\nth\ndone during 20 century and many books were written and seminars and symposia were held.\nIn 1971, the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) was set up as statutory body by\nIndian Government to regulate education. An effort to carry out integrated and coordinated\nresearch was made for the first time in India by the Indian Council of Medical Research\n(ICMR) in 1964 through the Composite Drug Research Scheme (CDRS). In 1970, this scheme\nwas transferred to the newly constituted Central Council for Research in Indian Medicine &\nHomeopathy (CCRIMH). Department of Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy\n(ISM&H) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India was created\nin 1995 with a view to develop Education & Research in Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy,\nUnani, Siddha and Homoeopathy systems. This was re-named as Department of Ayurveda,\nYoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) in 2003. The Department\ncontinued to lay emphasis on upgradation of AYUSH educational standards, quality control\nand standardization of drugs, improving the availability of medicinal plant materials, research\nand development and awareness generation about the efficacy of the systems domestically and\n3"}

However, Ayurveda is also popular in many\nforeign countries including USA and Europe. People use Ayurvedic medicines, which are\nmarketed as dietary/nutritional/herbal supplements.\n1.5\nStrength of Ayurveda\n1.5.1 Comprehensive definition of health: Ayurveda defines health as a state of equilibrium\nof dosa (regulatory and functional entities of the body), dhatu (structural entities), mala\n(excretory entities) and agni (digestive and metabolic factors) alongwith healthy state of\nsensory and motor organs and mind with their harmonious relationship with the soul. As\nagainst definition of health, the diseased state is defined in Ayurveda as a loss of equilibrium\nof essential body constituents. The objective of disease management is to bring back the\nequilibrium, principally through lifestyle management rather than through curative therapies.\nThe strength of Ayurveda lies in its three fold holistic approach of prevention of disease,\npromotion of health and cure of disease. This is achieved through care of body, mind and soul\nwhere physical, mental and spiritual aspects of health are considered.\n1.5.2 Acceptance by the community: About 80-90% of population in India is reported to use\nAyurveda and other traditional systems of medicine to meet their primary health care needs.\nSafety of this system is attributed to time-tested use substantiated by scientific evidences.\nBesides, synergy of ingredients in conjunction with individual need based treatment plan forms\nthe basis of efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic formulations. Specific guidelines are prescribed\nfor the use of apparently toxic medicinal plants with certain detoxification processing that also\nenhance the bioavailability and efficacy of the final product.\n1.5.3 Emphasis on promotion of health and prevention of diseases: Considering health of an\nindividual as dynamic integration of environment, body, mind and soul, Ayurveda lays great\nemphasis on preservation and promotion of health and preventing the occurrence of diseases.\nThe treatment modalities of Ayurveda are based on the inherent ability of the living body to\nrejuvenate, regenerate and restore the natural equilibrium. While treating the patient, Ayurvedic\ntreatment helps to enhance the natural healing process in the body.\nThe prevention of disease and promotion of health is achieved by judicious practice of\ndinacarya (daily regimen), rtucarya (seasonal regimen) and sadvftta (ethical code of conduct)\nin accordance with prakrti (psychosomatic constitution).

Do's and don'ts on personal\nand social behavior are elaborated for attaining total health. Great emphasis is given on\nNidana parivaijana i.e. keeping away from factors which cause or precipitate the disease,\nwhereas therapeutic procedures like pancakarma help in eradicating the disease.\n1.5.4 Importance of diet and lifestyle: The ultimate aim of this medical science is\npreservation of health and it can be attained in two ways, i.e. observation of lifestyle\nrecommendations to prevent the diseases and eradication of already afflicted diseases. The\nprerequisites to attain the prevention include wholesome diet, conservation of environment,\ncongenial social and cultural atmosphere. Diet is an essential factor for the maintenance of\nhealth. Ayurveda emphasizes on diversified aspects of dietetics and nutrition viz. quality,\nquantity, processing methods, rationale of combination of food articles, emotional aspects,\nnature of the consumer, geographical and environmental conditions etc. Advocacy of proper\ndiet and life style, which is congenial to the individual maintains normal body functions thus\nprevents the diseases.\n1.5.5 Holistic concept of health: Ayurveda considers a living being as a combination of\nbody, mind and soul.\nAll health management approaches are intended to maintain the\nharmony and homeostasis of these entities.\n1.5.6 Individualized approach: Ayurveda considers that each individual has distinct psycho­\nsomatic constitution and health status. This is taken into account while advocating preventive,\npromotive and curative measures.\n1.5.7 Universal approach: According to Ayurveda, the individual (microcosm) is a miniature\nreplica of the universe (macrocosm). Every aspect of the universe is represented in the\nindividual. Any change in the environment affects human being. Therefore, emphasis is laid\non social and environmental factors which are interlinked with health.\n1.5.8 Stress on public health and eugenics: The activities of the individual through his\nthought, word and deed have their good or bad effects on the environment. Ayurveda\nemphasizes upon healthy body, sound mind, benevolent speech and spiritual practices to create\na healthy and happy environment. The pivotal role of eugenics mentioned in Ayurveda is to\nproduce strong, healthy and ideal progeny.\n19"}

It is an accepted fact that\nAyurveda is playing an important role in conditions like bronchial asthma & bronchitis,\ncardiovascular disorders, osteoporosis, joint and connective tissue disorders and early stages of\ndementia, Parkinson's disease, osteoarthritis etc.\nAyurvedic treatment is effective in chronic disorders like sinusitis, diabetes mellitus,\nhypertension, obesity; psychosomatic disorders like depression, insomnia; digestive disorders\nlike irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), peptic ulcer, inflammatory bowel diseases; respiratory\ndisorders like bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; musculo-skeletal\ndisorders like arthritis, osteoporosis; neurological and neuro-degenerative disorders like\nparalytic conditions, sciatica, dementia, Parkinson's disease etc.\n1.5.11 Unique therapeutic approach: Ayurveda advocates certain bio-cleansing and\nrejuvenating therapeutic measures such as pahcakarma, rasayana for maintenance of healthy\nstate as well as in the management of chronic diseases. Ksarasutra, a minimal invasive para-\nsurgical procedure using medicated thread, widely cited in ancient medical literatures for its\nsafety and efficacy is being successfully practiced as promising therapy for ano-rectal\ndisorders. Such unique specialties of Ayurveda either as stand alone or add on therapies are\nproven to have an edge over conventional medical approach in disease management and\nimproving quality of life.\n1.5.12 The way forward: Ayurveda can contribute in the management of chronic and\nrefractory disease conditions sharing huge global burden such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis\nand allied conditions.\n20"}

Vata is derived from the basic element vayu and akasa, pitta\nfrom agni, kapha from\njala andprthvi.\ni.\nVata - The important function of vata is to impart movement, generation and conduction of\nimpulses, transportation of biological materials and elimination of waste products. In the\nnormal condition, vata performs entire neurological functions of the body. It sustains the\nentire machinery of the body. Vata is responsible for functioning of five sensory organs\n(Panca\njhanendriya) and motor functions also. It is a regulator of psychosomatic functions\nof the living body. When vata is vitiated or its equilibrium is disturbed, it brings about\nvarious psycho-somatic disturbances. All the basic emotions like worry, anxiety, fear,\ngrief, anger etc. are governed by vata. Usually all functions of nervous system at central\nand peripheral level is correlated with vata.\nii.\nPitta- Pitta represents transformation.\nIt governs digestion, absorption, assimilation,\nnutrition, metabolism, body temperature, skin coloration, luster of the eyes, intelligence,\nand understanding. Psychologically, pitta arouses anger, hate, and jealousy. Morbidity of\npitta may lead to insomnia, abnormality of body temperature, yellow discoloration of eyes,\nimpaired digestion/metabolism etc. Usually digestive juices, enzymes and hormones come\nunder this entity.\niii.\nKapha- Kapha is one of the primary constituent of the living body.\nIt exhibits\npsychological phenomena as the exhibition of the courage, forbearance, zest, virility,\nknowledge, understanding etc. Similarly, the physical function of kapha is responsible for\nthe physical strength, built, stability of structures, cooling, adhesion, lubrication,\n25"}

The health is maintained\nif they remain in balanced state and if they are deranged in any manner, they vitiate structural\nand excretory entities to cause vikara/roga (disease).\n2.1.4 Saptadhatn (Seven Structural Entities)\nThe structural elements in the body are classified as dhatu. They are seven in numbers and are\nresponsible for maintaining the body in a compact and composed state.\nThey are rasa\n(nutritional fluid), rakta (blood), mamsa (muscle tissue), medas (adipose tissue), asthi (bone\ntissue), majja (bone marrow) and sukra (reproductive elements^. According to Ayurveda,\nahara rasa (nutrient fluid) nourish these tissues. Apart from this, there are six upadhatu\n(supportive bye products of dhatu), namely stanya (breast milk), artava (menstrual fluid),\nkandara (tendons), sira (blood vessels), vasa (fat), tvak (skin), snayu (ligament).\n2.1.5 Ojas (Essence of dhatu)\nAyurvedic texts have vividly described the factor of immunity in terms of vyadhiksamatva,\nwhich is considered as the natural or acquired biological defense of an individual against\ndiseases. This power is attributed to the presence of a biological factor called ojas, the essence\nof the structural entities (dhatu), which literally means vigor. Ayurveda also describes a\nnumber of methods to promote ojas and vyadhiksamatva.\n2.1.6 Mala (Excretory Entities)\nMutra (urine), purisa (faeces) and sveda (sweat) are the three gross excretory entities. The\nexudates eliminated from eye, nose, mouth, ears and reproductive organs and other structural\nentities etc. are considered as subtle excretory entities. Proper elimination of these excretory\nentities is also required to maintain health. Their hypo, hyper and irregular state results in\ndiseases.\n2.1.7 Srotas (Micro and Macro Channels)\nThe concept of srotas occupies an important position in the development of conceptual frame\nwork of Ayurveda.

Seven types Dhatvagni (metabolic factors located at dhatu)\nJatharagni is the most important agni and supports the other type of agni. Derangement of\nagni viz. mandagni (down regulation), tiksnagni (hyper-active), visamagni (deranged state)\nlead to diseases and samagni (balanced agni) maintains the health of an individual.\n27"}

The mind is called\natindriya (beyond the perception of senses). The sense-organs receive the stimulus from the\nexternal world and are perceived through mind and passed to the atma (soul).The chief\nfunction of manas is assimilation and discrimination. It has been stated that it enables the\nbuddhi (intellect) to discriminate good and bad, right and wrong. It has normal functions like\nto think, to determine or decide, to express, to conceal, to recall, to concentrate, to memorize,\nto control emotion, to meditate etc. The emotional factors like lust, anger, greed, delusion and\nhallucination or confusion, malice, remorse and anxiety, fear, exhilaration are all responsible\nfor psychosomatic disorders. The above description of mind clearly indicates that it is a\ncontrolling component of the body and it is largely influenced by external socio-cultural\nfactors. The body can be prevented from the stress by controlling the mind. Patanjali in his\nYoga Sutra has clearly propounded yoga system for the control of mind and maintenance of\npositive health.\n2.1.10 Prakrti (Psychosomatic Constitution)\nThe structural and functional variations are the fundamental characteristics of human being.\nNo two individuals are exactly alike either in their morphological, physiological or behavioral\ndimensions. The individual differ in their genetic makeup and also in morphological and\npsychological aspects including their endocrine activity and metabolic efficiency. Ayurveda\nhas given maximum attention regarding the clinical significance of individual personality and\nalso recognized the dichotomy between mind and body and classified psychological\npersonality in terms of sattvika, rajasika and tamasika where as somatic constitution is\ndetermined by relative predominance of vata, pitta and kapha in an individual. Ayurvedic\nconcept of Prakrti parlksa is to know body- mind constitution to predict the susceptibility of\ndisease. Prakrti is considered while prescribing diet, medicine or treatment regimen to an\nindividual.\nCharacteristics of vata predominance p ra krti- Vata type person are thin, tall,\ndisproportionate, under-developed in general physique, chest is flat and depressed, veins are\nprominent and will have markedly projected ends of bone. Vata type individual looks\nemaciated with rough dark, pale, dusty complexion and dry cracked rough skin.\nPsychologically these persons are characterized by short memory and low will power.\n28"}

They\nhave least power of reasoning and they are of irritable temperament. They are comparatively\nnon-religious and coward. The life span of vata type individual is comparatively low. Due to\npredominance of rajas traits, vata type individuals are more susceptible to psychosomatic\ndisorders. A comprehensive regimen of life has been advocated for the prevention of diseases\nfor the vata type individuals in almost all the classical texts of Ayurveda.\nCharacteristics of pitta predominance prakrti- Pitta dominant individuals are medium in\nstrength, stature and body built. They have fair and coppery complexion, smooth, very soft &\nwrinkled skin and thin, silky and brownish hair. The psychological traits of such individuals\nare sharp, bright, intelligent and short tempered. If we trace the origin of\npitta personality from\ntriguna point of view, sattva predominates in this constitution. Individual of this type of\npersonality is more prone to blood borne skin and diseases. Therefore, such individuals have\nbeen advised to live in a cool place and use diet which is antagonistic to agnimahabhuta.\nCharacteristics of kapha predominance prakrti - Physically kapha type people are strong with\nheavy & proportionate body built and fair complexion. They are biologically strong; therefore\nare more virile and have good progeny. From psychological point of view such individuals are\nmentally stable with maximum capacity for retention. In Ayurvedic texts kapha type of\npersonality is considered to be the ideal type of personality because they take the balanced\napproach to life. They have maximum capacity to withstand stress. Since, kapha type people\nare biologically strong; they are less prone to develop psychosomatic disorders.\n2.1.11 Clinical diagnosis\nThe diagnosis in Ayurveda is based on two-fold approach viz. (1) examination of the patient\ni.e., rogi parlksa and (2) diagnosis of the disease i.e. roga parlksa.The rogi pariksa is\nessentially concerned with ascertaining the psychosomatic constitution and status of health &\nvitality of the individual. This is achieved through ten fold examinations (dasavidha pariksa),\neight fold examination (astasthana pariksa) three fold examination (trividha pariksa) of the\npatient. For the proper treatment of diseases, it is mandatory to understand the exact nature of\nthe disease with reference to dosa, dhatu, mala and agni. The diagnosis of the disease is also\ndone with the help of satkriyakala (six stages of pathogenesis), nidana pancaka (five fold\napproaches of diagnosis).\n29"}

The curative treatment consists of three\nmajor constituents, ahara (food), vihara (lifestyle) and ausadha (drug/ medicament). Ideal\ntreatment according to Ayurveda is one which cures the disease without causing adverse effect.\nThree classical therapeutic streams advocated by Ayurveda are (1) daivavyapasraya cikitsa\n(spiritual therapy) (2) yuktivyapasraya cikitsa (rational treatment) and (3) sattvavajaya cikitsa\n(psycho-behavioral therapy). The Ayurvedic treatment methods can be grossly divided into\nthree methods samsodhana (bio-cleansing therapy), samsamana (palliative therapy) and\nNidana paiivaijana (avoidance of causative factors). Samsodhana is the modality by which\neffort is made to remove disease causing factors like metabolic wastes/toxins from the body.\nThis is practiced through one or more therapies frompancakaima. Samsamana is the modality\nof treatment by which the disease causing factors are pacified inside the body and this is\nachieved through three types of therapies viz. food, lifestyle and medicine.\n2.1.13 Holistic and Individualized Approach\nAyurveda employs holistic and personalized approach to health. The holistic, integrative and\nsystems approach of Ayurveda involving body, mind, and soul is a pivotal attribute. Taking\nthe human being as a whole, the Ayurvedic preventive and therapeutic approaches aim at\nhomoeostasis of this integrated milieu. Diverse approaches of clinical examination and\ndiagnosis viz. Prakrti, agni, srotas, and satkriyakala etc. form determinants of individual\nspecific precise tailor-made treatment plan. Furthermore, the systems approach embodied\nwith Ayurveda concepts such as, disease process, diagnosis, principles of drug action,\nprocesses, dosage forms, diet, therapeutics and personalized approach towards lifestyle\nadvocacy, disease management are highly appreciated since antiquity which are now the\nevolving concepts of pharmaco-epidemiology, pharmaco-genomics of modem medical\nscience.\n30"}

Paiinama (effect of time, season and environment)\nPathogenesis of disease has six stages known as satkriyakala:\n1. Sahcaya (accumulation of dosa in their respective places)\n2. Prokopa (vitiation of accumulated dosa)\n3. Prasara (spread of deranged dosa)\n4. Sthansamsraya (accumulation of dosa at a particular site)\n5.

The nature of the disease can be understood with the help of the\nfollowing five means known as nidana pancaka:\n1. Nidana (cause of the disease) - The factors which cause diseases are known as\nnidana. Detailed description of the various categories of nidana is given in Ayurvedic\ntexts for particular diseases.\n2. Purva RSpa (prodromal signs and symptoms) - The knowledge of this stage helps\nthe physician in the diagnosis of the disease well before it is manifested.

They are mainly intrinsic and extrinsic. However, there are\nmany other classifications such as genetic, congenital, psychological, seasonal, spiritual etc. It\nhas been advised to plan the treatment according to the prognosis of the disease. Certain\ngenetic, congenital, neurological and surgical diseases are identified as incurable. Others like\nchronic and recurrent diseases are difficult to treat. Therefore, while deciding the treatment\nsuch limitations should be kept in mind. Broadly, the prognosis has been classified as sadhya\n(curable), kastasadhya (difficult to cure), yapya (maintainable) and asadhya (incurable).

Following eight factors related to\nconsumption of food need to be considered:\n1. Nature (prakrti) —\nNot all the food articles are suitable for everybody. In fact the\nsuitability of the food articles is dependent on the psychosomatic constitution of the individual.\nHence it is necessary that one should always consider the original nature of the food article in\nthe light of his psychosomatic constitution while consuming the food. In diseased state the\nstatus of the dosa and effect of the food on them need to be considered.\n2. Process of preparation (samskara) - The method of processing like frying, roasting etc\nhave a definite effect on the nature of prepared food. The processed food will have different\ncharacteristics than the original food. Appropriate processing technique can make the food\nsuitable for the consumer in accordance with the requirements.\n3. Compatibility (samyoga) —\nFood articles when used in combinations may either be useful\nor harmful. Combination of food material having opposite properties may prove harmful to\nthe consumer. Illustrations of such harmful combinations are given in the Ayurvedic texts\n(Viruddhahara). The consumer should always avoid such harmful food combinations.\n4. Quantity (rasi) —\nThe quantity of food as a whole or item wise need to be considered.\nLight food also if consumed in excess is likely to be harmful. Heavy foods should always be\nconsumed in small quantity. In this reference the stomach is considered to be divided into four\nparts. Out of these two parts have to be filled with solids and one part with liquids. The\nremaining one part should always be left empty.\n5. Habitat (desa) - Habitat is geographic region. Specific food is either suitable or not\nsuitable according to variations in the climatic condition of the area.\n6. Time (kala) - Eating schedules need to be observed every time one takes food.\nConsumption of food at odd hours is detrimental to the health. Seasonal variations also need\nto be considered while selecting food materials.\n37"}

In order to be optimally healthy, one should tune\nthe body to the nature's master cycle which in turn regulates the various other rhythms. To\nachieve this, Ayurveda prescribes a specific routine in general and also on the basis of\npsychosomatic constitution of an individual. This includes waking up early in the morning,\nexcretion of bio-wastes, taking care of oral hygiene (cleaning of teeth and tongue, gargling),\nexercise, massage, bath, clothing, sleep, eye care, nasal therapy etc. The various aspects of this\ndaily routine in general are:\nWaking up- Since our biological clock is tuned to the rising and setting of the sun, it is\nadvisable to wake up before the sunrise in perfect synchronization to the natural clock. An\nideal time to wake up is brahmamuhurta (1-2 hours before sunrise).\nNatural Urges- Dawn is the best time to eliminate the body's physical waste. Drinking one or\ntwo glass of warm water in winter season and normal water in other seasons before sunrise\nhelps in proper elimination of\nmala and renders multiple health benefits.\nOral Hygiene- Brushing of teeth and cleaning the gums are advised early in the morning and\nafter each meal by using the twigs/thin stems of different plants like Neem (Azadirachta\nindica), Khadira {Acacia catechu) etc. Scrapping the tongue using tongue cleaners made up of\nmetals or plants are advised. The gargling with water, decoctions and medicated oils keeps\ngum, mouth, teeth and throat healthy.\nExercise- Exercise increases the body's stamina and resistance to disease by facilitating the\nimmune system, clearing all channels, promoting circulation & waste disposal and destroying\nfat. Exercises may be in the form of yoga or walking etc. Depending on age and body type,\nkapha type can go for heavy exercises, pitta type should do it in moderation and vata type\nshould perform light exercises. Exercise should not be done during illness and just after meal.\nMassage- The gentle oil massage everyday makes the skin supple; controls vata by reducing\nits cold, dry, light, rough and erratic qualities; enhances blood circulation; encourages\nelimination of\nmetabolic wastes and relaxes the body.\nBathing- Warm bath is advisable for the body and cold water for the head.\nClothing- Clothing should always be clean, light and made of natural fibers as cotton, wool or\nsilk. The use of natural perfumes in moderation promotes pleasant feeling.\n39"}

The person with disturbed sleep should massage\nthe feet with oil before going to bed.\nBrahmacarya - In the broad sense it means control of the senses or indriya especially sexual\nlife. More specifically, it refers to celibacy or chastity. Like all traditional spiritual traditions,\nAyurveda advocates restraining from indulging in sensual gratification. The more broad\ndefinition of brahmacarya also includes conduct that leads to the realization of the self. The\nconservation of energy that comes from practicing celibacy is converted into ojas. Many\npeople mistakenly believe that practicing brahmacarya means suppression of the natural urge\nbut on the contrary anything that is suppressed will eventually lead to disorder.\nEye care- Washing the eyes every morning with clean and cold water or decoction of triphala\nis very useful. Use of a medicated collerium (sauvirahjana) every day is also recommended\nfor the healthy eyes.\nNasya (nasal instillations) - Regular inhalation of the Anu taila, the oil prepared by boiling 26\ndifferent medicinal plants in gingelly oil and goat's milk prevents all ailments of the eyes, hair,\nnose and the ears.\n3.2.3 Adbaraniya Vega (non suppressible natural urges) - There are thirteen natural urges,\nsuppression of which leads to many diseases as given below:\n1. Suppression of urge of urination may lead to difficulty in passing urine, urinary stone,\natony of\nbladder and inflammation of urinary tract.\n2. Suppression of bowel movement may lead to pain in abdomen, indigestion, gas in\nabdomen, headache.\n3. Suppression of flow of flatus may lead to pain in abdomen, indigestion, heart diseases,\nconstipation or diarrhoea.\n4. Suppression of flow of semen may produce pain in testis and difficulty in intercourse.\n5. Suppression of urge for vomiting may lead to different types of diseases like urticaria,\ngiddiness, anaemia, hyperacidity, skin diseases and fever.\n6. Suppression of sneezing may produce rhinitis and chronic cold, headache, sinusitis and\ndiseases of respiratory system.\n40"}

One\nshould control the urges of greed, envy, hatred, jealousy, lust etc. and gain control over the\nworldly pleasures.\n3.2.5 Rtucarya (Seasonal Regimen)\nAccording to Ayurveda the dosa and the rtu (seasons) are interlinked. Health is affected by the\nnature of the climate as outer environment influences the body. For example, when the air is\ndamp, cold and wet it increases these qualities in the body leading to aggravation of kapha,\nwhich has similar qualities. Hence there is an increase in mucous, catarrh and colds in winter.\nThere are various environmental factors like temperature, humidity, wind, rain, clouds and\natmospheric pressure and sunlight etc. that affect individual's health. Rtucarya is the\nobservance of diet and regimen according to the seasonal changes. In Ayurveda, a year is\ndivided into two kala (cycles) or periods based on the apparent position of the sun in the north\nand southern directions. They are:\n1.\nUttarayana - Northern solstice\n2.\nDaksinayana - Southern solstice\nUttarayana is also called adanakala or the taking away period. The sun and wind are powerful\nduring this period. The energy of the body is diminished. Due to the heat, air becomes hot and\ndrains the cooling effect of earth. Due to this, people get dehydrated and weakened and the\natmosphere becomes hot and dry.\n41"}

According to the principles of Ayurveda, there is not a single substance\nin the Universe which does not have a potential to be used as a medicine. Around 6000 species\nof medicinal plants are documented in published medical and ethno-botanical literatures in\nIndia. Ayurveda takes into account the action of the drug in its entirety. It holds that the\naction of the whole drug is often different from that of any one of its constituents considered\nseparately. A section called dravyaguna vijhana is the description of crude drugs used in\ntherapeutics.\nPharmaco-dynamics of drugs in Ayurveda is described on the basis of rasa the taste, guna the\ntherapeutic property, virya the potency, vipaka and prabhava the specific therapeutic action.\nThese five factors are responsible for the drug action.\n4.1.1 Rasa- Six types of perceptible tastes are described in Ayurveda. They are madhura\n(sweet), amla (sour), lavana (salty), katu (pungent), tikta (bitter) and kasaya (astringent). The\nactions of the drugs are basically described in accordance with the effect of drug on dosa as\nevery taste is associated with a specific action on dosa. The sweet, sour and salty tastes are\nunctuous in nature and hence promote kapha and pacify vata dosa. The pungent, bitter and\nastringent drugs are dry in nature and promote vata and pacify kapha. The astringent, bitter and\nsweet drugs cause pacification ofpitta.\n4.1.2 Guna- The guna is physical property of the drug described in Ayurveda, which is related\nto the therapeutic action of the drug. There are ten pairs of guna which are as follows: guru\n(heavy) - laghu (light), sita (cold) - usna (hot), snigdha (unctuous) - ruksa (rough), manda\n(dull) - tiksna (sharp), sthira (immobile) - sara (mobile), mrdu (soft) - kathina (hard), visada\n(non-slimy) - picchila (slimy), slaksna (smooth) - khara (rough), suksma (fine) - sthula\n(gross), sandra (solid) - drava (liquid).\n46"}

It is\nessentially the biological property which needs to be protected and preserved in a drug. It is\nalso mentioned that every action of a drug is controlled by virya viz. sita virya and usna\nvirya.\n4.1.4 Vipaka- The end product of digestion and metabolism of a drug which is responsible for\nthe action is vipaka. Vipaka is not perceived directly like taste but is inferred from its effects\non dosa, dhatu and mala. The three major types of vipaka are madhura, amla and katu. The\nmadhura, amla and katu vipaka drugs promote kapha, pitta and vata dosa respectively.\n4.1.5 Prabhava: Prabhava is a specific action of drug which cannot be explained on the basis\nof its rasa, guna, virya or vipaka. In other words, this action is not related to any of the\nrasapancaka.\nApart from the description above, different other types of drug actions are enlisted in\nAyurveda but those actions are related to one of the rasapancaka mentioned above.\n4.2 Pharmaceutics\nSubstances distributed in the universe are derived from plants, animals or minerals, which also\nserve as the drug sources. These sources cannot be used as a drug in their natural form. Hence\nalmost every substance has to undergo a specific processing to acquire the form of a drug.\nSuch processing is termed as bhaisajya kalpana (pharmaceutics) in Ayurveda. The form which\nultimately comes into use by the patient is termed as a drug delivery system or drug dosage\nform. Safety, efficacy, stability and palatability are the four basic requirements of a good drug\ndosage form. Ayurveda gives prime importance to these four basic requirements.\nThe\npharmaceutical procedures for any drug involve various steps starting from identification and\ncollection of authentic raw material, application of standardized processing techniques and\nproduction of quality drug to packaging and storage of the finished drug.\nIn Ayurveda both single drug and compound formulations are used for therapeutic purposes.\nInitially five dosage forms (Pancavidha kasaya kalpana) viz. svarasa (expressed juice), kalka\n(paste), kvatha (decoction) hima (cold infusion) and phanta (hot infusion) were formulated.\nAll these were meant for immediate use due to their short shelf life. To increase the shelf life\nof the drug, the preparations with more stability viz. vati, (tablet), guti (pill), taila and ghrta\n(medicated oil/ghee) were introduced later.

Other commonly used Ayurvedic dosage forms are curna\n(powder), arka (distillate), ksara (acrid substance), asava- arista (medicated fermented\npreparations) and parpati (medicinal flakes). The details of dietetic preparations such as\nvarious types of gruels, soup is also available. Different drug delivery systems were taken into\nconsideration while designing new dosage forms like ointment/ cream, syrup, granules,\ncapsules, candy etc.\nIn Ayurvedic therapeutics, fresh as well as dried plant materials are used for processing\ndepending on availability and necessity.\nThese drugs are used singly or in simple\ncombinations. It is necessary that the form of the drugs or formulations when ready for\ningestion are only effective but also easy to administer and acceptable to the patient. The main\nemphasis is on removing the physical and chemical impurities, contaminants and undesired\nconstituents from the crude drugs. To meet this requirement basic materials are sometimes\nsubjected to purifying process known as sodhana. Utmost importance has been given to the\nquality of raw ingredients. Proper season for collection and part of the plant to be used has\nalso been emphasized.\nThe type of pharmaceutical processing depends mainly on following factors:\n1. Nature of the raw material; fresh or dry\n2. Required quantity of the dosage form\n3. Solubility of therapeutically useful component of the plant\n4. Heat stability of therapeutically useful component of the plant\n5. Route of administration\n6. Acceptability by the consumer\n7.

Such harmful and toxic effects of inappropriately processed metals and minerals\nhave been described in Ayurvedic classics. However Ayurvedic scientists believed that if\nproperly processed, metals and minerals can be successfully put to therapeutic use. On this\nbackground intensive and elaborate processing techniques were evolved to make the mineral\nand metal substances fit for therapeutic utilization.

Furthermore they are\ninstantly effective in very small doses in a wide variety of diseased conditions.\nIt is to be noted that the metal and mineral based preparations mentioned in Ayurvedic classics\nare safe and efficacious. Several studies carried out over the years and many recent studies\nshow that toxicity is not normally observed at the therapeutic dose level if used in an\nappropriate manner.

This five fold therapy is aimed at sodhana i.e., the eradication of\nthe basic cause of disease and later to achieve samana, mitigation of the disease.\nPancakarma is essentially applicable in a wide range of preventive, curative and promotive\nconditions.\nThese therapies are advocated even in a healthy person to combat seasonal\nimbalance of dosa. Ayurveda quotes that the disorders treated with this mode of therapy do\nnot recur while those treated with palliative methods do have ample chances of recurrence.\nThese measures are preceded by snehana (internal or external administration of medicated oils\nor fats), svedana (induction of sweating) and followed by samsaijana karma (restorative\nregimen after\npancakarma).\nVamana has been claimed as the best treatment for diseases of\nkapha, virecana for diseases of\npitta and basti for diseases of vata. Classically pancakarma therapy is prescribed and practiced\nthrough following schedule viz. (1) purva karma (preparatory procedures^, (2) pradhana karma\n(main procedures^ and (3)pascat karma (post procedure measures).\n5.1.1 Purva karma\nBefore the administration of\npancakarma therapy, the patient is prepared suitably with snehana\nand svedana as preparatory measures. Pancakarma therapy should not be undertaken without\npurva karma as it otherwise fails to eliminate the dosa located in the tissues.\nThe\nadministration of oil/fat in snehana renders the body soft, liquefies dosa so that they become\namenable to disintegration and detachment from the tissues. Svedana therapy dislodges the\nvitiated dosa stagnated in the subtle channels of circulation thus facilitating the pradhana\nkarma to easily eliminate the dosa through respective pathways. Some times snehana and\nsvedana are also used as independent therapies.\ni. Snehana: Administration of mostly medicated preparations containing oil, ghee or fat to a\npatient for a limited period to get the desired clinical effect is called snehana. Sneha\npacifies abnormal vata, renders the body soft and clears the accumulated wastes which\nhave obstructed the body channels. Further, the regular and rational use of fats has been\nconsidered beneficial for the proper digestion, cleansing of the bowel, the promotion of\nbody strength and integrity of senses besides several other beneficial effects of oleation.\nOil, ghee or fat based preparations can be administered through different kinds of foods,\nmassage etc. according to the feasibility. The ghee or oil may either be used singly or in\nmedicated form or may be mixed with other drugs.\n56"}

Two types of measures are\nemployed for sweating, (1) by using heat generated through fire (sagni sveda) and\n(2) without use of fire (niragni sveda) i.e. by exposure to sun, physical exercise, staying in a\nclosed room, administration of\ndifferent kinds of\nalcoholic beverages, covering the body with\nthick clothes, walking etc. Care should be taken while performing svedana at certain parts of\nthe body such as eyes, testis and\npre-cordial region.\n5.1.2 Pradhana Karma\nAfter preparing the patient with snehana and svedana the patient is subjected to the main\nmeasures of pancakaima - vamana, virecana, nasya, basti and raktamoksana as per\nrequirement.\ni.

The aim of rasayana is not only to improve the\nquality of rasa; but to provide the optimum quantity to all the body tissues. It is the rasa\nflowing in the body which sustains life. Rasayana is a specialized branch of clinical medicine\nmeant for preventing the effect of ageing and to improve memory, intelligence, complexion,\nsensory and motor functions. Numerous rasayana medicines are reported for possessing\ndiversified actions like immuno-modulation, free radical scavenging, adaptogenic or antistress\nand nutritive effect. From the therapeutic point of view rasayana may be of two types: kamya\nrasayana and naimittika rasayana. kamya rasayana has been advocated for healthy individuals\ndesirous to improve their health and vitality. Depending upon the mode of administration the\nrasayana therapy is broadly classified in to vatatapika and kutipravesika. In vatatapika\nrasayana, individual is allowed to attend to his routine work and also undergo the rasayana\ntreatment. In contrary to this, in kutipravesika rasayana the individual has to be confined to\nindoor and not allowed to move in open air and sunlight and also to undergo rasayana therapy.\nThe acara rasayana is a type of non-drug management in which by practicing specified code of\nconduct one can get the desired effects of\nrasayana.\nNote to the readers: Ayurveda adopts diversified therapeutic approaches.

A special focus is given to\npurification and other processing of potentially toxic plants and metalo-mineral materials.\nIn ancient times, the Ayurvedic physicians prepared medicines for their patients by following\nin-house standards. Today, the production and sale of Ayurvedic drugs has become formalized\ninto a thriving industry. With increased use of drugs of these systems and commercialization\nhas brought with it many challenges about safe use of Ayurvedic medicines. The scope for\nadulteration, preparation of counterfeit drugs and development of formulations which do not\nhave conceptual basis in these systems has increased. Further, the cultivation of medicinal\nplants with laboratory generated species is being attempted on the basis of chemical\ncomposition and is\nlikely to be\nused in increased manner for commercial purpose. These\nchanges may have profound impact on\nthe safety and efficacy of the ASU drugs in the market.\nHence a mechanism is required to put in place to address them. According to the amendments\nto Rule 170 of Drugs & Cosmetics Rule 1945, the safety and toxicity studies have become the\npart of drug development process as and when prescribed. There are national guidelines\navailable on in-vitro, in-vivo and clinical testing of safety and toxicity, which are framed on\nthe basis of global requirement.\nDuring recent past, certain Ayurvedic\nformulations\nwere\nquestioned\nfor\ncontaining heavy metals\nand studies\nconducted by CCRAS on the formulations\nviz. of Svarna Maha Yogaraja Guggulu,\nNavaratna Rasa,\nMaha Laksmivilasa\n'\n*\nRasa, Mahasudarsana Ghana Vati have\nbeen found to be safe.

A National Pharmaco-\nvigilance Resource Centre at Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda,\nJamnagar, as National Pharmaco-vigilance Resource Centre for Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani\nDrugs (NPRC-ASU) in India was established for coordinating National Pharmacovigilance\nProgram.

Ayurveda was also taught in\nGurukula system. Gurukula system is an ancient Indian concept of education, wherein the\nparticipants got knowledge by residing with his teacher as part of his family and by following\nself discipline. The student was allowed to start independent practice after obtaining the\ncertification from the guru. The guru also had to follow the prescribed code of conduct. The\nprocess of selecting suitable student by the teacher, and suitable teacher by the student\nhas been described in Ayurvedic classics. The classics also describe ideal methods of\nlearning: self-study, teaching and discussions. The knowledge at that time was also\nexchanged through professional gatherings, seminars and symposia.\nThe ancient medical education system in India was a wholesome balance between the theory\nand practice. The practical training had three main objectives:\n• Preparation of medicine\n• Examination of the patients, diagnosis of the diseases and Practice of medicine\n• Practice for surgery , initially on dummies\nGurukula, the personalized teacher based\nInstitutions were later developed as full\nfledged Institutions.

Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani-Tibb at under-graduate\nand post-graduate level.\nThe CCIM with the prior approval of Government of India has prescribed minimum standard\nrequirements (MSR) for Ayurveda colleges.\nThe MSR include norms for infrastructure,\nteaching & training facilities, student-bed ratio, hospital departments etc. There is another set\nof regulations prescribed for post graduate education in Ayurveda. PG regulations include\nnorms for teaching facilities, student-teacher ratio and specialties for post graduation.\nPresently, the various courses of Ayurveda are being conducted by different colleges under the\nsupervision of Indian universities:\n1.

Such sage-physician-surgeons of the time were\ndeeply devoted holy people and saw health as an integral part of spiritual life. The information\nabout the ancient practitioners of Ayurveda is available mainly through the texts that they have\nwritten. Ashwinis were the twin physicians to both humanity and divine personalities who are\ncredited for discovering a popular rasayana called cayavanaprasa. Atreya, Agnivesa, Caraka\nwere famous physicians. Susruta, the ancient surgeon has elaborately mentioned management\nprocedures for anal fistula, fractures, obstructed labour, amputation, excision of tumours,\nrepair of hernia, couching of cataract, rhinoplasty, lobuloplasty and skin grafting in his treatise\nSusruta Samhita. The court physicians (Rajavaidya) were responsible for the health of the\nking and his family. They also ensured the quality of food for the royal family. Jivaka was a\nfamous physician - surgeon to lord Buddha. The practice of Ayurveda continued at individual\nand institutional level.\nThe practice in this system is being regulated through IMCC Act 1970 and the register of\ntrained practitioners is maintained by the Boards duly established. Professionals with medical\nqualifications granted by Universities, in or outside India which is recognized by CCIM are\nallowed to register and practice in India. There are three types of Ayurvedic practitioners in\nIndia.\n• Traditionally trained practitioners under the guidance as apprentices of some experts.\nThey were registered till the new provisions of IMCC Act, 1970 came in to force.\n• Institutionally qualified trained practitioners having degrees in Ayurveda.\n9 9"}

There are other government ministries and departments of the\ngovernment such as defense, railways, police, ports and mines who have their own health\nservices institutions for their personnel. The health care in public sector is either free of cost or\ninvolves nominal user charges.\nThe private health sector consists of the 'not-for-profit' and the 'for-profit' health sectors. The\nnot-for-profit health sector includes various health services provided by non government\norganizations (NGO's), charitable institutions, missions, trusts, etc. Health care in the for-\nprofit health sector consists of various types of practitioners and institutions. The Ayurvedic\ndoctors provide their services through both these public and private health sectors.\nAs on 2011, the health care services are being extended to the masses through a huge network\nof 429246 registered Ayurveda practitioners, 2420 Ayurveda hospitals, and 15017\ndispensaries. The medicines are dispensed in either dispensary attached to the clinic or the\nhospital by the outside pharmacies through the prescriptions. Ayurvedic procedures like\npancakarma and ksarasutra are also practiced in the specialty centers established at different\nlevels.\n7.2.1 Mainstreaming of AYUSH\nThe health care system in India is very unique as various indigenous systems are widely\naccepted and practiced parallel to the mainstream allopathic system of medicine. The AYUSH\nwas formally institutionalized in modem India as far as education and service delivery are\nconcerned. It was further integrated with the government health services at central government\nhealth scheme (CGHS), employees' state insurance hospitals, state level dispensaries, and other\nprimary and tertiary setups. Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi is the first institution that\nconceived the idea of integrating the ancient and modem systems of medicine both at the level\nof education, research and professional practice. Under NRHM, AYUSH doctors are recruited\nand co-located at primary health centres (PHC)/ community health centres (CHC)/ district\n100"}

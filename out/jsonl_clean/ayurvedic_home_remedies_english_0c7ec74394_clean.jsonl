These efforts are on from time\nimmemorial. These endeavors have thrown up various\nsystems of medicine. Ayurveda is one such system evolved\nin India, which tries to bring harmony between man & nature\nby using holistic methods of diagnosis, prevention and\ntreatment. Like all other Indian contributions it is intertwined\nwith Indian philosophy, yoga and science.\nThe modem since is successful in inventing medicines for\nmany diseases. But complete health is still a mirage for the\nmankind. Strong synthetic drugs are creating innumerable\nside effects known & unknown sometimes making the\ntreatment more dangerous than the disease itself. As a\ncontrast Ayurveda preaches gentle way of treatment mainly\nbased on herbs and diet. Many of most effected drugs are\nsimple, easily available and can be prepared at home.\nThis Booklet offers some simple recipes prepared from\nthe materials available in and around the kitchen, For simple\nproblems like cough, cold, indigestion etc, these preparations\nare very effective. For chronic problems like diabetes, joint\npain, skin diseases these remedies may be used even along\nwith other medication.\nI hope that this\nbooklet\nwill be\nbeneficial to\nthe readers.\nG.

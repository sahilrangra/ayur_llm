Ayurveda provides the\nmethod for living a balanced life, for the prevention of disease and pain and for the\ntreatment of diseases presently thought to be incurable. Unfortunately, during the period\nof British occupation of India, traditional arts, including the science of Ayurveda, were\nactively discouraged; ‘Vaidyas’, or accomplished Ayurvedic masters, were persecuted\nand numerous libraries and schools were burned to the ground. Since that time of foreign\noccupation, India and it’s culture have slowly been recovering. But the truth is that\nAyurveda still remains in a semi-dormant state, a state of hibernation, waiting for those\nearnest and perseverant students who will bring Ayurveda back to it’s full capacity.\nFortunately there are a few excellent texts which have been preserved from ancient times.\nThe Charaka Samhita is such a text. Recorded several thousand years ago from the\nteachings of the sage Punarvasu Atreya, it is a gem of practical wisdom which remains to\nthis day the most respected work on Ayurveda. And fortunately for those students not\nfluent in Sanskrit, a few good translations to English have been written.\nSo, what is unique about this version you are holding now? Great as the original\nCharaka Samhita is, it is challenging to read. Information is scattered over hundreds of\npages and thousands of ‘sutras’. Further, it was written in poetic format which facilitated\nthe memorization of the full text, but resulted in sentences that could confuse the\ninexperienced. Without ample insightful explanation from living teachers, this text has\nbeen out of reach to the average Ayurvedic student, simply too much effort. I offer this\nversion as a comprehensive, user-friendly textbook for the medical student, and as a\nreference book for health practitioners. However, even the newcomer to Ayurveda will\nfind interesting information on healthy living for happiness and longevity. The content\nof this book has been taken completely from P.V. Sharma’s English translation of the\nCharaka Samhita. Mr. Sharma has created an excellent English translation, with\npainstaking attention to correct interpretation of the details such as vocabulary, grammer\nand pharmacopoeia. Therefore, I have used the translations from his book word-for-word\nas the base of this book. Students who wish to study the original sutras from the Charaka\nSamhita are directed to the above text or one of the other fine translations. P.V.\nSharma’s edition is available through Chaukhambha Orientalia Publishers in New Delhi,\nIndia. What I have done is spend several thousand hours interpreting and testing this\ninformation from an applied clinical standpoint. The information has been collected by\nsubject. Unnecessary language has been pared down, in an attempt to illuminate the\nintended meaning of each aphorism. Compact, difficult portions have been expanded and\nexplained. Headings have been installed at the beginning of each new group of\ninformation. Where appropriate, information has been grouped into charts for easier\nvisual association. And what were complex bundles of formulas have been divided into\nindividual formulas and written out into a recipe format so one may at a glance get a feel\nfor the basic ratios and procedures involved. Finally, the information has been grouped\ninto coherent chapters and larger “sections”. At the same time I have done my best to\npreserve the core message that was intended in each sentence of the original text. You\ncan be confident that no information from the original text has been left out; this is not an\nabridged version. Consequently, when I did not feel confident to make an interpretation\nof a sentence or statement, I left it as I found it. You will notice that much of the text in"}

You will be\nsurprised by the array of interesting information.\n3)If you are under the care of an Ayurvedic doctor, or want to follow an Ayurvedic\nlifestyle, you only need to read Section 4, Healthy Living. You may also wish to read\nSection 1, Principles. Some parts of this book are technical, so if you are new to\nAyurveda an introductory book such as Dr. Vasant Lad’s “Ayurveda, the Science of SelfHealing” may also be helpful.\n4)If you are a practitioner, you will find diagnosis and treatment by disease name listed in\nthe table of contents for Section 8, Specific Diseases. Further detail on evaluation,\nprinciples and treatments can be located in the other sections as needed. I should\nmention here that if you look at the table of contents for Section 8, Specific Diseases you\nwill notice that there are a lot of diseases which are not listed. Further, there are disease\ncategories which do not exist in Allopathic medicine. The outsider to Ayurveda may feel\nthat this categorization in the Charaka Samhita is incomplete and antiquated. However,\nthe further one studies and applies the diagnosis and treatment given in this classic text,\nthe more one is impressed that this classification is complete, competent and in several\ncases is perhaps superior to the allopathic classification of diseases.\n5)If you are a student, you may wish to read the chapters in order, or as your curriculum\nrequires. One hint: studying at the beginning all of the table of content pages for each\nchapter is a good introduction to the breadth of Ayurveda, and will help you locate\ninformation when you need it in future.\n6)Comments by the editor will be printed in italics or inside [brackets]. Items of\nparticular interest will be marked in bold or with a * symbol.\n7)When studying a statement, you can read it “backwards” to get twice as much\ninformation out of it. For example, in the statement “Antagonism of foods becomes inert\ndue to: suitability, strong digestive power and young age” we can learn the direct\nstatement, i.e. that suitability, strong digestive power and young age will all help us to\navoid the problems of taking antagonistic foods. But we can also get insight about the\nnature of youth; there is something about youth that makes it particularly conducive to\nthis effect. So, this one aphorism can tell us about not only antagonism of foods, but also\nabout the characteristics of youth. All the statements in the Charaka can be used in this\nway to glean twice as much useful information.\n8)Take the aphorism statements literally. You may be surprised by the wide yet specific\napplication of what are apparently obvious aphorisms of the Charaka.\n9)It is recommended that you learn most of the Charaka before applying it; there are\nmany potentially dangerous procedures and medicines here. Also, the knowledge\nrequired for their proper management is interspersed throughout the eight sections, not\njust in the particular section it is listed. Many of the statements of the Charaka do not\ncome into full meaning until viewed in context of the rest of the work. So, when\nsomething doesn’t make sense, continue studying the surrounding aphorisms or other\nrelated passages for clues. For example, the right application of a purgative formula may\nbe further clarified upon study of paragraphs on “strength of the patient” and\n“softness/hardness of the bowels”."}

Sutra means thread, because, like\nthe surgical word to “suture”, a thread strings together a series of ideas. The Charaka\nSamhita is written in verse, to be chanted with a rhythm and meter. This aided the\naspiring student in committing the sutras to memory. Unfortunately the rhyme and meter\nof the sutras are lost when translated into English, though we may catch their meaning.\nIn order to aid scholars who wish to compare this edited version of the Charaka with\nsutras of the original, I have included sutra references. Each sentence, paragraph or chart\nwill have a sutra reference below it, which indicates which sutras the information comes\nfrom. It looks like this:\nDefinition of Apasmara:\nIt is defined as departure of memory associated with entering into\nunconsciousness and convulsions due to derangement of mind.\nCi14#26-29\nA sutra reference is read like this:\nCi\n14\n#26-29\nsection\nchapter\nsutras\nHere are the Sections and their abbreviations from the original Charaka Samhita:\nSection Name\nAbbreviation\nNumber of Chapters\n(there are 120 in all)\nSutrasthana\n(summary)\nSu\n30\nNidanasthana\n(diagnosis)\nNi\n18\nVimanasthana\n(measurement)\nVi\n8\nSarirasthana\n(on the body)\nSa\n8\nIndriyasthana\n(senses)\nIn\n12\nCikitsisthana\n(treatment)\nCi\n30\nKalpasthana\nKa\n12\nSiddhisthana\n(skill)\nSi\n12\n11\nSection 1\nPrinciples\nDefinitions and Theory p.12\nThe 10 Pairs of Qualitie p.20\nThe 5 Elements p.21\nThe 6 Tastes p.22\nThe 3 Doshas (Body Humors)- Vata, Pitta and Kaph p.35\nAnatomy p.49\nAgni (Digestion/ Metabolism) p.73\nMind, Senses and the Soul p.74\nTime and seasons p.93\nTypes of Land p.99\n12\nDefinitions and Theory\nPhysician\nAyurveda\nHappy life\nHealthy person\nThe 8 Branches of Ayurveda\nSimilarity and Dissimilarity\n*Substances\nSupreme Self\n“Paradi”- means of success in treatment"}

Whether he is eternal or non-eternal? What is Prakrti\n(nature)? What are the products? What are the signs of the personal self?\nThe knowers of the self regard the self as: inactive, independent, omnipotent,\nomnivagant, omnipresent, knower of the body and witness. Then O Lord! How there is\naction of the inactive? If independent, how is he born in an undesired form of existence?\nIf omnipotent, how is he inflicted forcibly by painful entities? If omnivagant, how does\nhe not perceive all the sensations? If omnipresent, why does he not see (an object)\ninterrupted by a hill or a wall? There is no doubt as to which is earlier body-knower or\nthe body itself? Because without earlier existence of the knowable body there can not be\nknower of the same and if the earlier existence of the body is accepted, then the knower\nof the same would be reduced as non-eternal. When there is no other doer whose witness\nis he? How be there the variations of painful sensation in one devoid of abnormality? O\nLord! Out of the 3- past, present and future- which of the painful sensations of the patient\nis treated by physician? The reason of the doubt is that the future one has not yet\nreached, the past one has already passed and the present one also is not stationary. What\nis the cause of the sensation and its substratum? Where do all these sensations cease\ncompletely? By what signs is known the omniscient, detached from all, free from all the\nconjunctions, one, calm, the self of the creatures?

The aggregate of 24 entities is known as “Purusa”\n(the person).\nSa1#35\nThe person associated with (predominant) rajas and tamas has endless conjunction of this\ntype but when these 2 are subdued with the predominance of Sata, the conjunction ceases\nto exist.\nSa1#36\nHere are dependent the action, fruit (of action), knowledge and ignorance,\npleasure and pain, life and death and ownership.

Thus evolved and complete with all the organs the\nperson is born and is said as emerged.\nSa1#66\nAt the time of dissolution, the self gets detached from these enjoyable entities.\nThus (the self), subdued by rajas and tamas, gets manifested from the unmanifest state\nand then reverts to the unmanifest and thus moves continuously like a wheel (from one\nstate to another). Thos3e who are attached excessively to duals and are engrossed by ego\nare subjected to origin and destruction but not others who are contrary to them.\nSa1#67-69\nInspiration and expiration (respiration), twinkling of eye etc. (reflexes), biological\nfunctions, psychic [[mental?]] movements, shifting from one sense organ to another,\nimpulsion and restraint (of mind), mentally arriving at another country, sound sleep as if\none is dead, perception of an object by left eye which is received by right eye, desire,\naversion, happiness, misery, will, consciousness, control, knowledge, memory and ego–\nthese are the signs of the self.

The aggregate of 6 constituents is termed as “universe” (macrocosm) such as–\nprthivi, ap, tejas, vayu, akasa and unmanifest Brahman (principle of consciousness).\nThese very 6 constituents aggregated are termed as “Person”.\nSa5#4\n** In the Person prthivi, ap, tejas, vayu, akasa and brahman are represented by\nform, moisture, heat, vital breath, pores (including vacant spaces) and inner self\nrespectively. ** As is the magnificence of Brahman in the universe so is that of inner self\nin the person. * In the universe the greatness of Brahman is represented by Prajapati and\nin the Person the same of the inner self is represented by the psyche. ** What is Indra in\nthe universe is ego in the person, Aditya (the sun) receiving, Rudra agitation, Soma (the\nmoon) cheerfulness, Vayu happiness, Aswins lustre, Marut enthusiasm, Visvadeva all\nsense organs and their objects, darkness ignorance, light knowledge; as initial creation in\ncase of the universe so impregnation in the person, krtayuga childhood, treta youth,\ndwapara old age, kali illness, and end of creation death.

The root cause of the universe as well as\nthe advent of all miseries is inclination to worldly affairs while going away from them\nleads to their cessation.

During sisira,\none should avoid pungent, bitter, astringent, light, cold and V-increasing food and drinks.\nSu6#19-21\nDuring spring, the accumulated K irritated by the strong rays of the sun disturbs\nthe body-heat and thus causes many diseases.

Su1#3\nAt first, Prajapati received Ayureda in it’s entirety as propounded by Brahma,\ntherefrom Aswins (received), from Aswins lord Indra received it fully, that is why\nBharadwaja, as requested by the sages, came to Indra.\nSu1#4-5\nWhen diseases cropped up creating impediments in penance, abstinence, study,\ncelibacy, religious observances and life-span of living beings, the holy great sages, out of\nsympathy on creatures, assembled on one of the auspicious sides of the Himalayas.\nSu1#6-7\nAmong them were Angira, Jamadagni, Vasistha, Kasyapa, Bhrgu, Atreya,\nGautama, Sankhya, Pulastya, Narada, Asita, Agastya, Vamadea, Markandeya,\nAsvalayana, Pariksi, Bhiksu Atreya, Bharadwaja, Kapinjala, Viswamitra, Asmarathya,\nBhargava, Cyavana, Abhijit, Gargya, Sandilya, Kaundinya(lya), Varksi, Devala, Galava,\nSankrtya, Baijavapi, Kusika, Badarayana, Badisa, Saraloma, Kapya, Katyayana,\nKankayana, Kaikaseya, Dhaumya, Marica, Kasyapa, Sarkaraksa, Hiranyaksa, Lokaksa,\nPaingi, Saunaka, Sakuneya, Maitreya, Maimatayani along with the sages of the\nVaikhanasa and Valakhilya orders and other great sages.

Now it was apparent that this was a great obstacle for human beings. What\ncould be done? The Sages concentrated on this problem, and with their concentrated\nvision, they saw Indra as savior. That god of gods is only able to tell the correct means\nof amelioration.\nSu1#15-17\nThe sages asked, who should go to the abode of Indra to inquire about this? First\nspoke Bharadwaja, “I may will go for this mission” and so he was sent to Indra’s abode,\nwhere he saw the killer of Bala sitting in the midst of the group s of godly sages and\nglittering like fire. He approached him with felicitating words of praises and blessings\nand submitted the message of the sages humbly and in the best possible way- “Diseases\ncausing fear in all living beings have appeared, so O Lord of gods, tell me the proper\nmeasures for their treatment”. Then Lord Indra, having observed the wide intelligence of\nthe great sage, delivered to him Ayurveda in a few words.\nSu1#18-23\nHe Said: “Ayurveda continuing from time immemorial and virtuous was known\nby Brahma (the creator) first.”\nSu1#24\nBharadwaja, the intelligent and concentrated sage, acquired the endless and 3pronged Ayurveda properly and entirely in a short time. By this Bharadwaja attained\nimmeasurable happy life-span and he transmitted that knowledge, as it is- neither more\nnor less- to the sages.\nSu1#25-26\nThe sages, desirous of long life, too received that benevolent Veda (compendium\nof knowledge) of promoting life-span from Bharadwaja. The great sages further grasped\nproperly the knowledge of samanya (similarity), visesa (dissimilarity), guna (properties),\ndravya (substance), karma (action) and samavaya (inherence) by which they followed\nfirmly the tenets of the compendium and attained the highest well-being and nonperishable life-span. Su1#27-29\nNow Punarvasu, out of friendliness, and prompted with compassion for all\ncreatures, bestowed the virtuous Ayurveda upon his six disciples- Agnivesa, Bhela,\nJatukarna, Parasara, harita and Ksarapani.\nSu1#30-31\nIt was only the extraordinary merit -and not different instruction- that made\nAgnivesha the author of the first compendium of Atreya’s teaching. Afterwards, Bhela\nand the others also wrote their own texts and all of them, intelligent ones, presented their\nworks before Atreya in the presence of a group of sages. The sages, on hearing the\ncomposition of benevolent topics were extremely pleased and approved it with the\nremark that they were properly composed. All praised them, the benefactors of all\ncreatures, along with the loud applause for the compassion on all creatures. The loud\nvirtuous words of the great sages were heard by the godly sages and gods living in\nheaven and they were extremely delighted. The deep and affectionate sound of “well\ndone!” expressed by the creatures with happiness in the sky resounded the three worlds.\nThe pleasant wind began to blow, all corners blossomed with lustre and there were divine\nshowers of flowers and water. Then the goddesses of knowledge Buddhi (intelligence),\nSiddhi (success), Smrti (memory), Medha (intellect), Dhrti (restraint), Kirti (fame),\nKsama (forbearance) and Daya (kindness) entered into Agnivesa and the other sages/\ndisciples.

On the contrary, the faulty or\notherwise statement of a drunkard, insane person, fool or attached person should not be\nconsidered testimony. Vi4#4\n(See also “The Teacher” in section on Study.)\nDefinition of Perception: “Perception is that which is acquired by the sense organs and\nmind directly” -Vi4#4\nIt is the knowledge which arises by the contact of self, sense organs, mind and\nsense objects. It is explicit and limited only to the present.\nSu11#20\nDefinition of Inference: “ Inference is reasoning supported by invariable concomitance.”\n-Vi4#4\nIt is based on prior perception. It is of 3 types and is related to the 3 times [past,\npresent, future]. For example, one can infer covered fire from the smoke, sexual\nintercourse from observing the fetus and the future fruit from the seed. By observing the\nbearing of similar fruit, the learned infer the causation of the seed.

Medicament is that which serves as equipment for\nthe physician making effort for effecting balance of dhatus particularly different from the\nentities ending with procedure [as listed above] (original source, inclination, place, time\nand procedure). From the point of view of agents employed, medicament or therapy is of\n2 types– spiritual and rational. In spiritual therapy incantation, roots, gems, auspicious\nrites, offerings, gifts, oblations, observance of rules, expiation, fasting, blessings, bowing,\nvisit to temples etc. are employed. In rational therapy, evacuative and pacificatory\nmeasures as well as fruitful activities are employed. It is again of 2 types according to\nform– material and non-material. The non-material therapy includes upayas (devices\nother than drugs). Upaya means formless entity like terrorizing, creating surprise,\nforgetfulness, agitation, exhilaration, chiding, threatening for murder, binding, inducing\nsleep, gentle massage etc. It also includes the aforesaid means of treatment. The\nmaterial therapy consists of drugs which are used for emesis etc. The drug is examined\nin respect of nature (natural composition), properties, action, habit, time and mode of\ncollection, storage, processing, dosage, indications for use, the constitution of the patient,\nand the effect on disorder, whether eliminates it or pacifies it, any other drug of this type\nshould have the same characters.\nVi8#87\n3) The Original Source:\nThe original source is the imbalance of dhatus which is known by the emergence\nof the disorder.

Examination of the patient is conducted for\nthe knowledge of the span of life or of the degree of strength and morbidity. Now, (we\ntake up) the examination of patient for knowledge of the degree of strength and\nmorbidity. The variations in quantity of drugs according to the degree of morbidity\ndepend on the degree of strength, because if intensely potent drug is administered\nsuddenly by a physician having not examined properly, it may kill the weak patient; the\nweak patients are not able to bear intensely potent drugs which are predominant in agni\nand vayu [fire and air] or cauterization, application of alkali and surgical operation. They\nmay cause instantaneous death due to unbearable and over-intense impulse of the drug.\nKeeping this in mind, the physicians treat the weak patients with drugs which are\nunharmful, mild, delicate, heavy in progressive order, without complication, and not\ncreating any emergent condition, particularly ladies, because they have unstable, soft,\nbare and timid heart, are mostly delicate, weak and subordinate to others. On the other\nhand, the drug having low potency and applied by one who had not examined properly in\nstrong patients having severe disorder becomes ineffective. Hence the patient should be\nexamined in respect of prakrti (constitution), vikrti (morbidity), sara (constitution\n[strength] of dhatus), samhanana (compactness), pramana (measurement), satmya\n(suitability), sattwa (psyche), aharasakti (power of intake and digestion of food),\nvyayamasakti (power of exercise) and age for the knowledge of the degree of strength.\n[These factors have been listed and described.

Thus physicians attribute various nomenclatures to dosas and\ndisorders classified in different groups according to various factors.”\nVi6#11 [Nearly verbatim is O.K. for this edition!]\n[Primary vs. Secondary Disorder (cont.):]\nDisease is also observed as serving the purpose of etiology in respect of (another)\ndisease. For example, hyperpyrexia gives rise to internal hemorrhage which in turn\ncauses fever and both together give rise to phthis. From enlargement of spleen arises\nudararoga and from udara appears edema. From piles arises terrible udararoga and also\ngulma. Coryza gives rise to cough which produces wasting which results in causation of\nphthisis.\nNi8#16-19\nInitially they are only disorders, and later on serve as etiological factors. At times\nthey serve the purpose of both (disease and etiology) and sometimes of only one (either\ndisease or etiology).\nNi8#20\nBecause some disease, after causing another disorder, subsides while the other\ndoes not subside and at the same time also serve as etiology.\nNi8#21\nThus obstinate intermingling of diseases is observed due to [1)] faulty treatment\nand [2)] origin from one another.\nNi8#22\nThe therapy which pacifies one disorder but at the same time gives rise to some\nother disorder is not correct; the correct treatment is that which while pacifying (a\ndisorder) does not excite (another one).\nNi8#23\nOne cause produces several disorders or sometimes only one. Likewise, one\ndisorder is caused by many factors and sometimes many disorders are caused by those\nones. For instance, from rough substances arise fever, giddiness, delirium etc. and\nsometimes fever only. Likewise, many factors such as rough etc. cause only fever while\nsometimes they produce many disorders in addition to fever.\nNi8#24-26\nOne symptom pertains to many diseases as well as one disease. Likewise, many\nsymptoms arise is [in] one disease as well as many diseases. For instance, fever is the\n(common) symptom of many diseases having irregular onset and complicated origin\nwhile hyperpyrexia is the symptom of fever only. Many symptoms related to irregular\nonset and complicated origin are found in fever while the same are observed also in\nseveral diseases like fever, dyspnea, hiccup etc.\nNi8#27-29\nOne pacificatory measure is useful in many disorders as well as in single disorder.\nLikewise, many measures are required for a single disorder as well as multiple ones.

We shall\nmake use of these properties-rasa, virya, vipaka and prabhava for those who are devoted\nto us and whom we like, because there will not be any difficulty in counteracting the\nepidemic disorders if the drugs are well-collected, well-processed and well-administered.\nVi3#4\nWhy does an epidemic effect everyone in a community?\nEven though people differ in constitution, strength, age, etc., they may all\nsuccumb to the epidemic, due to 4 factors which become deranged.

Such as- excessive gazing at the over-brilliant objects is\nexcessive use, avoiding looking altogether is negative use and seeing too near, too\ndistant, fierce, frightful, wonderful, disliked, disgusting, deformed and terrifying objects\nis perverted use of visual objects. Likewise, to hear too much the loud sound of clouds,\ndrums, cries etc. is excessive use; not at all hearing is negative use and hearing of harsh\nand frightful words and those which indicate death of dear ones, loss, humiliation etc. is\nperverted use of auditory objects. Too much smelling of too sharp, intense and\ncongestant odors is excessive use, not at all smelling is negative sue and smelling of\nfetid, disliked, impure, decomposed, poisoned air, cadaverous odor etc. is perverted use\nof olfactory objects. Likewise, too much intake of rasas (tastes) is excessive use, not at\nall taking is negative use of gustatory objects. Perverted use of those will be described in\nthe chapter dealing with the methods of eating except the quantity. Too much indulgence\nin very hot and very cool objects and also in bath, massage, anointing etc. is excessive\nuse of tactile objects; total abstinence from them is negative use and application of tactile\nobjects such as hot and cold bath etc. without the usual order and also the touch of\nuneven surface, injury, dirty objects, organisms etc. is perverted use of tactile object.\nSu11#37\nSo the condition of all the sense organs produced by the overall tactile sensation, when\nthey are harmful, is known as unwholesome conjunction of sense organs and it’s objects\nwhich is of 5 types each having 3 sub-divisions. The objects which are accepted properly\nare known as wholesome ones.\nSu11#38\nAction is application of speech, mind and body. Too much application of these is\nexcessive use and their total non-application is negative use. Holding up or forcing of\nurges, sleeping, falling and posturing on uneven places, abnormal posturing, heating,\npressing, obstructing breath and torturing is the perverted use of bodily actions. Words\nindicating betrayal, lying, untimely speech, quarrel, unliking, irrelevance, indiscipline\nand harshness etc. come under the perverted use of speech.

But by\ndistinguished Daiva, Purusakara is subdued.\nVi3#33\nMethod of attaining the desired life-span:\nThe great sages try to obtain the desired life-span by penance.\nWholesome regimen is the basis of life; contrary is that of death.\nTimely Death:\nAn axle fitted in a vehicle which is endowed with all the natural quantities carries\non and perishes in time by depreciation of it’s normal limit; similarly, the life-span in a\nbody of a person having strong constitution and managed properly gets it’s end and loss\nof its normal limit. Such death is known as timely. On the other hand, the same axle gets\ndestroyed in the way due to overload, uneven road, want of road, breaking of wheels,\ndefects in vehicle or driver, separation of the bolt, non-lubrication and throwing about,\nsimilarly the life-span comes to end in the middle.\nVi3#38\nThe life-span in a body of a person having strong constitution and managed\nproperly gets it’s end and loss at it’s normal limit (100 years).\nCauses of untimely death:\nLife-span comes to an end in the middle due to over-exertion, diet not in\naccordance with agni, irregular meals, complicated body postures, over-indulgence in\nintercourse, company of ignoble persons, suppression of impelled urges, non-suppression\nof suppressible urges, infliction with organisms, poisonous winds and fire, injury and\navoidance of food and medicaments. Also due to fever etc. due to faulty management.\nVi3#38\nArgument Against Pre-determined Life-span:\n[...Weak daiva is subdued by the stronger purusakara. Likewise, by the\ndistinguished daiva purusakara is subdued...] Observing this some hold the determined\nspan of life, but, in fact, some superior deeds exhibit results determined in time while\nothers have such determination in time. This is known by observation.\nVi3#33-35\nHence because both types of causes are observed one-sided view is not correct. I\nwill explain it with examples. If there be determined life-span for all there would not be\nany necessity to apply mantras, herb-roots, gems, auspicious rites, offerings, gifts,\noblations, observance of rules, expiation, fasting, blessings, bowing, visit to temples etc.\nwith a desire for longevity nor there be any need to avoid excited, fierce and moving\ncows, elephants, camels, asses, horses, buffalo and terrific winds etc. Likewise, one\nwould not abstain from water falls, mountains, uneven and difficult places and strong\nwater current, from careless, insane, excited, fierce and unstable persons and those\ninflicted with confusion and greed; from enemies, from furious fire, from various\npoisonous reptiles, serpents etc. from over-exertion, from behavior unsuited to place and\ntime, and from king’s wrath, because these and other similar factors should not be\ndestructive because of entire life having been determined span. Moreover, the living\nbeings who have not practiced the alleviative measures against the happening of untimely\ndeath should not be subjected to such happening; all the talks of great sages for initiation"}

Moreover, the living\nbeings who have not practiced the alleviative measures against the happening of untimely\ndeath should not be subjected to such happening; all the talks of great sages for initiation\n218\nand knowledge of application in the chapter of rasayana [Chikitsasthana; in context of\ntreatment of specific diseases] would be useless; even Indra should not be able to kill\nwith thunderbolt his enemy with determined life-span; why should Aswins treat the\npatient with therapeutic measure? Why should the great sages try to obtain the desired\nlife-span by penance? It would also not be necessary for the great sages along with the\nlord of the gods (Indra), who already know all that is worth knowing, to ses, to instruct\nand to behave properly.\nExcellent among all the visions is the one pertaining to Indra, which is possessed\nby us as well, with this it is observed like this– there is dissimilarity in life-span of\nthousands of persons who are those not indulged in fighting battles; similarly in those\nwho counteract or do not counteract the disease immediately after it is arisen; there is\nalso dissimilarity in life-span of those who take poison or not; there is no similar fate of\nthe jars carrying water and those in pictures (or kept only for decoration). Hence\nwholesome regimen is the basis of life and the contrary is that of death. Over and above,\norderly and proper use of food and activities which are contrary to the properties of place,\ntime and self, abstaining from excessive, negative and perverted use in respect of all\n(time, action and senses), holding up of psychic excesses (emotions), non-suppression of\nnatural impelled urges, avoidance of over-exertion we take these as the cause for\ncontinuance of health and accordingly also instruct and observe properly.\nVi3#36\n(on Life-span):\nMy view on existence and non-existence of timely and untimely death is like\nthis– some say whoever dies does so in time because there is no gap in time. This is not\ncorrect as there is no point in discussion about the gap or otherwise with regard to time\nbecause time has got its own characters due to nature. Others say– when somebody dies\nis his fixed death time. Death is true for all beings because of equal dealing. This also is\nwrong interpretation of fact. Equal dealing does not mean that there is none who does\nnot die. The present context is the time which relates to the span of life. If one holds that\nthe time when somebody dies is the time of death for him, then according to this all\nentities would be determined in respect of time but this is not correct because it is\nobserved that the result of untimely food, speech and action is harmful otherwise useful.\nMoreover, there is clear usage of “time” and “un-time” in relation to different conditions\nand entities such as– this is the time or not for this disease, food, medicament, therapy\nand remission. Even in common usage they say- it rains timely or untimely, this cold\nweather is timely or untimely, that heat spell is untimely or untimely, flowering and\nfruiting of plants is happening in time or otherwise and so on. Hence both are true–\ntimely death and untimely death. There is no scope for any exclusive view. If there be\nno untimely death and all would have determined life-span, then in that case there would\nnot be any purpose of the knowledge of the wholesome and the un-wholesome. Over and\nabove, perception, inference and testimony would not be recognized as means of valid\nknowledge which are recognized as such in all the scriptures and which provide\nknowledge about the factors conducive or otherwise to life-span. Therefore, the sages\nhold the view that there is no untimely death is only a jugglery of words.\nSa6#28\nDuring this age [[referring to one of the “Yugas” from a millennium-scale\ncalendar.

Meat of female and small animals. Old grains (at least 1 yr), [all old\nfoods]. Food taken in little quantity. Salt. Predominate in Agni and Vayu. Processing:\nfrying makes light.

Cheese., fish, yogurt,\nSu27#332-333, 336-337, 340-341\nHeavy Foods to Use Moderately:\nA person, after having taken food, should never eat heavy preparations of flour,\nrice and flattened rice. Even when hungry, one should take them in proper quantity.\nSu5#9\nOne should not take constantly dried meat, dried vegetable, lotus tubers and stem\nbecause of their heaviness. The meat of emaciated animal should not be taken. Similarly\none should not take continuously kurcika and kilata (milk products), pork, beef, buffalo\nmeat, fish, curd, black gram and yavaka.\nSu5#10-11\nProcessing: example: roasted grain flour (light) becomes heavy when boiled into\na dumpling. -Su27#339\nBy processing, the heavy food articles become light and vice versa.

Over-obesity is caused by over-saturation, intake of heavy, sweet, cold and fatty\ndiet, indulgence in day-sleeping and exhilaration, lack of mental work and genetic defect.\nThere is excess of fat in him and further only fat is accumulated and not the other dhatus\nso, thus the life-span is shortened; because of laxity, softness and heaviness of fat there is\nhampering in movement; due to non-abundance of semen and the passage having been\ncovered with fat, there is difficulty in sexual intercourse; due to disequilibrium of dhatus\nthere is debility; foul smell is due to defect and nature of fat and also sweating, due to\nassociation of medas with K, it’s oozing nature, abundance, heaviness and intolerance to\nphysical exercise there is over-sweating; because of intensified agni (digestion) and\nabundance of V in the belly there is excessive hunger and thirst.\nSu21#4\nV, due to passage having been obstructed with fat, moves about abundantly in\nbelly and thus stimulates digestion and absorbs food. Hence the person digests food\nquickly and desires excessively the intake of food. In case of delay in taking food he is\nafflicted with some severe disorders. These 2- agni and V- are particularly complicating\nand as such burn the obese like the forest fire burning the forest. In the event of\nexcessive increase of fat, the dosas suddenly give rise to severe disorders and thus\ndestroy the life shortly. The person is called as over-obese who, due to excessive\nincrease of fat and muscles, has pendulous buttocks, abdomen and breasts and suffers\nfrom deficient metabolism and energy. Thus is described the defects, cause and\nsymptoms of the obese.\nSu21#3-9\nHereafter, the features of the over-lean will be explained. Indulgence in rough\nfood and drinks, fasting, little diet, excessive subjection to evacuative therapy, grief,\nsuppression of natural urges including those of sleep, non-unctuous anointing in rough\npersons, indulgence in bath, constitution [having a lean or V-type body since birth], old\nage, continued disorder and anger make a person over-lean. The over-lean does not\ntolerate physical exercise, over-saturation, hunger, thirst, disease and drugs and also too\nmuch cold, heat and sexual intercourse. The over-lean often becomes a victim of spleen\n(enlargement), cough, wasting, dyspnea, gaseous tumor, piles, abdominal diseases and\nalso the disorders of grahani. The over-lean is the person who has dried up [too small]\nbuttocks, abdomen and neck; prominent vascular network; only remnant of skin and bone\nand with thick nodes.\nSu21#10-15"}

Hence katutumba\nis the best one as emetic and also eliminates impurity by enema.”\n“katutumba is unsuitable due to hotness, sharpness, pungency and roughness.\nDhamargava is the best alleviator of K and P.”\n“No, Dhamargava is V-aggravating, depressant and debilitating. Kutaja is the\nbest one which alleviates K and P but does not affect strength.”\n“Kutaja is exceedingly absorbent of fluid, emetic and excites V. Krtavedhana is\nthe best one because it alleviates severe K and P and does not aggravate V.”\n“Krtavedhana is too pungent and debilitating.”\nThus after listening to the arguments, son of Atri said- “there is nothing which is\ndevoid of demerits and merits, so only predominance of merits will be considered. So\njimutaka is useful in kustha, iksvaku in prameha, fruit of kutaja in heart disease,\ndhamargava in anemia, krtavedhana in udararoga, while madana is universally\napplicable. It is sweet, slightly astringent, bitter, rough, pungent, hot and absorbent of\nfluid. It alleviates K and P, is quick-acting, free from untoward effects and carminative\nfor wind. That is why it specifically acquired the title “phala” in spite of existence of\nother fruits.” -all above Si11#3-14\nHow an Enema Functions:\nThe enema, performing all the merits and performing all functions, does\nnot go up beyond umbilical region and moves only below it up to the anus. So how does\nit eliminate impurities from the whole body?\nThe body is controlled by V through removing the retention and it alone\nor in combination of other dosas gets vitiated in it’s own location. Enema, by way of\nevacuation, carminates V with P, K and feces.

On the other hand, as the suppression of the\nimpelled urges of sneezing etc. gives rise to afflictions, the non-straining for the\ndelive4ry of fetus in time produces similar results.” She should be asked to follow the\ninstruction. Accordingly, initially she should strain mildly then gradually with stronger\neffort. While she is straining, the other women should speak in her ears– “just delivered\na worthy son”. Thus she is filled with joy.\nSa8#40\nWhen she has delivered the child, immediately it should be observed whether\nplacenta has been expelled or not. In case it has not come out, one of the attending\nwomen should press strongly above the navel with the right hand and hold her on the\nback with the left one and thus shake her body strongly. The pelvic region should be\nrubbed with her heel. Her buttocks should be held fastly and be pressed strongly. The\nthroat and palate should be touched with her hair braid. The vagina should be fumigated\nwith the leaves of bhurja, kacamani and slough of the serpent. She should be asked to\ndrink the paste of kustha and talisa mixing it in the soup of balwaja or strong spirituous\nportion of maireya and sura (types of wine), or the soup of horse gram, or decoction of\nmandukaparni and pippali.

After\nwashing his mouth, his anterior fontanel in head should be covered with a cotton swab\nsoaked in some fatty substance.

The oblation of offering of rice to the fire\nshould be performed continuously twice a day till the naming rite is solimnised. At the\ndoor after the threshold a wooden pestle should be kept obliquely. A cloth packet\ncontaining caca, kustha, coraka, hingu, mustard, linseed, garlic, kanakanika and other\ndrugs repelling evil spirits and well-tied should be kept at the front door. The same\nshould be worn by the mother as well as the child in the neck and also put in cooking\nvessels, water jars, cot and both the panels of the door. There should be fire burning\nconstantly with the fuel of kanakanika and tinduka wood within the maternity home. The\nsaid attending women and favorite friends should keep up the whole night near the\nmother for 10 or 12 days.

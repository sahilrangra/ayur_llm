INTRODUCTION\n224\n1.1 Traditional, complementary and integrative medicine\n225\nTraditional medicine (TM) is present across all six regions of the World Health\n226\nOrganization (WHO) in both codified and non-codified systems and is profoundly\n227\nrooted in its traditional medical knowledge (TMK), culture, history and territories. TM\n228\nthat has been adopted and adapted to the local context is referred to as\n229\n“complementary medicine”. The terms “traditional medicine” and “complementary\n230\nmedicine” are considered as interchangeable.\n231\nThe WHO traditional medicine strategy: 2014-2023 (15) provided the context of\n232\ntraditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) - a merger of the terms “traditional\n233\nmedicine” and “complementary medicine”.\n234\nAs people become more empowered to choose the right health care for their needs,\n235\nhealth services today have to meet this challenge and offer a people-centred approach.\n236\nThe practice of integrative medicine (IM), whether government-led or patient-led, that\n237\ncombines proven TM and biomedicine will become more common.\n238\nIn 2017, WHO effectively expanded its mandate for the much-needed support of\n239\nMember States in the developing field of IM and introduced the concept of “traditional,\n240\ncomplementary and integrative medicine” (TCIM).\n241\nThis strategy therefore provides an expanded vision comprising TM, T&CM and TCIM.\n242\nThis latter term brings together these three approaches, which are appropriately based\n243\non individual health needs.\n244\n1.2 WHO mandate and support of TCIM\n245\nIn 2014, the Sixty-seventh World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted the resolution\n246\nWHA67.18 on TM, which requested the Director-General to facilitate Member States’\n247\nimplementation of the WHO traditional medicine strategy: 2014–2023. WHO has\n248\ncontinuously supported TM, T&CM and TCIM in implementing TM strategies according\n249\nto the mandate of the WHA.\n250\nFollowing the Seventy-sixth WHA decision, WHA76(20), to develop a new global TM\n251\nstrategy for the period 2025–2034, WHO conducted the third WHO global survey on\n252\nTCIM to provide opportunities for Member States to review and provide input on\n253\ngovernance, financing, physical infrastructure, health workforce, products, information\n254\nand research, models of care, quality, access and availability, service coverage, and\n255\nresponsiveness, including Member States’ challenges and needs related to TCIM.\n256\nMember States have requested technical and policy guidance from WHO to help\n257\naddress the following challenges (20) (21):\n258\n•\nthe need for research data and financial support for research;\n259\n•\nthe need for mechanisms to regulate, control and monitor the quality of T&CM\n260\npractitioners and the safety, quality and effectiveness of T&CM practices and\n261\nproducts; and\n262\n•\nthe need for expertise, cooperation channels and information-sharing mechanisms\n263\nto help inform and bridge the gap due to the current lack of policy guidance on the\n264\nintegration of T&CM into health systems and services.\n265"}

The WHO global report on\n269\ntraditional and complementary medicine 2019 and the interim data of the WHO third\n270\nglobal survey on TM have shown steady progress and an advancing trend in multiple\n271\nareas.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES\n377\nThe strategy was developed based on the following principles, which also guide the\n378\nimplementation of actions by Member States, partners and stakeholders and WHO in\n379\nachieving its vision and goal.\n380\n5.1 Evidence-informed decision-making\n381\nDecisions should be informed by the best available evidence from research, as well as\n382\nby factors such as context, public opinion, equity, feasibility of implementation,\n383\naffordability, sustainability and acceptability to stakeholders (23). Decisions for the safe\n384\nand effective use of TCIM may be enhanced by appropriate robust research and use\n385\nof technology, which in turn furthers education and continuous learning.\n386\n5.2 Holism and health\n387\nTCIM encompasses various complete medical systems rooted in holistic perspectives,\n388\nemphasizing the interconnectedness of the human being not only within itself, but also\n389\nwith the environment and the properties that arise from their interactions. These\n390\nsystems, developed across diverse cultures and backgrounds, conceptualize health\n391\nas restoring and maintaining the balance and wholeness of individuals (24), thus\n392\ncontributing to a positive vision of health that integrates physical, mental, spiritual and\n393\nsocial well-being.\n394\n5.3 Sustainability and One Health\n395\nModern health care, including TCIM, should prioritize therapeutic interventions that\n396\nconsciously support environmental sustainability. In general, TCIM is rooted in natural\n397\nresources, traditional knowledge, culture and history and can contribute significantly\n398\nnot only to safeguarding biodiversity by promoting sustainable practices, but also to\n399\nachieving the SDGs related to health and well-being and to the One Health concept.\n400\n5.4 The right to health and patient autonomy\n401\nThe WHO Constitution asserts health as a fundamental human right, emphasizing\n402\nuniversal access to needed health services without financial hardship. The right to\n403\nautonomy in health decisions necessitates support for informed choices.\n404\n5.5 Culture and health\n405\nInterculturalism is essential for the acceptability of health care.

TCIM\n413\nadvocates for personalized care and respect that takes account of cultural preferences\n414\nand an inclusive, collaborative approach closely aligned with the concept for the\n415\nimplementation of modern primary health care.\n416\n5.7 Integrated health care services and user benefit and safety\n417\nFor optimal outcomes, health services should be coordinated seamlessly across\n418\ndifferent medical disciplines and should prioritize individual well-being while\n419\nsafeguarding against unsafe practices, false claims and unethical practices. Integrating\n420\nsafe, effective, and sustainable T&CM can contribute to an approach which\n421\nemphasizes factors that support human health and well-being. The ongoing\n422\ndevelopment of evidence-informed practices, continuous quality assurance and\n423\nregulatory mechanisms is essential to support the effective integration of T&CM into\n424\nhealth services (25).\n425\n6. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, DIRECTIONS AND ACTIONS\n426\n6.1 Strategic objective 1. Optimize the cross-sector value of TCIM and empower\n427\ncommunities through inclusive approaches.\n428\nRationale\n429\nThe knowledge, attributes and value of TCIM offer the potential to cope with challenges\n430\nacross multiple dimensions such as health, culture, environment, and social and\n431\neconomic factors – including poverty reduction. TCIM’s unique value includes a wide\n432\nrange of knowledge and procedures, such as medicines, foods, procedure-based\n433\ninterventions, manual therapies and spiritual healing practices. Policies and\n434\napproaches for the appropriate use of TCIM include capitalizing on its potential in\n435\nhealth services and self-care, both of which are critical in primary health care.\n436\nIndigenous TMK holds essential wisdom, which is vital for Indigenous Peoples, and\n437\nhas an immense potential with respect to the health of humans, animals, plants and\n438\nthe environment. To take advantage of these benefits, Indigenous Peoples should be\n439\nensured appropriate protection of their knowledge so they feel safe to share it more\n440\nwidely.\n441\nResearching the attributes of TCIM while engaging communities, partners and\n442\nstakeholders in its outcomes may unlock its value across sectors and inform\n443\ngovernance and societal approaches to maximizing its contribution to health, social\n444\nwell-being, One Health and the achievement of the SDGs.\n445\n446\nDirection 1.1: Include TCIM in cross-sector policies and action plans for health, well447\nbeing societies, One Health and SDGs.\n448"}

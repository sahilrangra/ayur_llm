These strategic\npriorities are supported by three strategic shifts: stepping up leadership; driving public health impacts\nin every country; and focusing global public goods on impact.\nTraditional medicine has always had a role in this collective endeavour. The Declaration of Astana,\nrenewed from the Declaration of Alma-Ata towards universal health coverage and the SDGs, reaffirms\nthe role of traditional medicine in strengthening primary health care, a cornerstone of health systems,\nin pursuit of health for all. This has also been reflected in the WHO global report on traditional and\ncomplementary medicine 2019, in which 88% of WHO Member States acknowledge the use of\ntraditional and complementary medicine in health care.\nTaking note of the growing importance of traditional medicine in the provision of health care\nnationally and globally, WHO and its Member States have strived to explore ways to integrate,\nas appropriate, safe and evidence-based traditional and complementary medicine services within\nnational or subnational health systems, as committed to in the Political Declaration of the High-level\nMeeting on Universal Health Coverage.\nWHO aims to provide policy and technical guidance to Member States; promote the safe and effective\nuse of traditional and complementary medicine through appropriate regulation of products, practices\nand practitioners; and support Member States in harnessing the contribution of traditional and\ncomplementary medicine to people-centred health care in implementing the WHO Traditional\nMedicine Strategy 2014–2023.\nSetting norms and standards is a unique function of WHO. The normative work is driven by needs\nand could be translated into real impact in relevant countries through appropriate policy options.\nThis series of benchmarks, covering various systems and interventions of traditional, complementary\nand integrative medicine, aims to provide a reference point to which actual practice and practitioners\ncan be evaluated.\nI am very pleased to introduce this series to policy-makers, health workers and the general public,\nand I firmly believe it will serve its purpose.\nZsuzsanna Jakab\nDeputy Director-General\nWorld Health Organization\nv"}

These describe in detail the\nprinciples and methods of diagnosis and treatment in the clinical domains of internal medicine (kāyacikitsā); obstetrics and maternal, neonatal and paediatric health (kaumārabhṛtya); mental illness and\ndiseases due to external influences invisible to the naked eye (graha cikitsā); diseases of the head and\nneck (śālākya-tantra); diseases requiring surgical or parasurgical interventions (śalya-tantra); diseases\ndue to external toxins (agada-tantra); care of elderly people and regenerative medicine (rasāyanacikitsā); and reproductive and sexual health (vājīkaraṇa-cikitsā).\nMahābhūta (basic elements)\nThere are five basic elements, or mahābhūta: space (ākāśa), which allows room for materials to exist;\ngaseous state (vāyu), which is the basis for motion; heat (agni), which allows energy exchange; liquid\nstate (āpa), which allows materials to bond together; and solid state (pṛthvī), which allows materials\nto have mass.\nDoṣa\nDoṣa are biological factors formed as a result of the synchronized interplay between the five\nbasic elements (mahābhūta) within a living system. They evolve through the processes of life and\nsimultaneously influence its course. They are embodied in different structural elements of the body\n(dhātu) and metabolic products in a living system. The robustness of their function maintains the\nnormal physiology of the body. Disturbance to their function is the basis for disease.\nThe doṣa are vāta, which maintains functional balance through the processes of motion; pitta, which\nmaintains functional balance through the processes of transformation; and kapha, which maintains\nfunctional balance through the processes of cumulation.\nDhātu\nDhātu are structural elements of the body. The metabolic process involves functions such as providing\nenergy, nourishment, binding/covering and shape, allowing for movement of structures, providing\nstructure, replenishing lost tissues, and procreation. Structural elements of the body that take part\nin performing one set of these body functions are classified together as a specific dhātu.\nMala\nMala are substances of metabolism that, in normal physiology, are to be excreted naturally without\nfurther transformation (metabolism) in the body. Mala also have functions in the body. Solid faecal\nmatter formed at the end of the correct digestive process supports the body functions, urine carries\nwith it all the naturally formed internal metabolic wastes of the body, and sweat manages the external\nmetabolic wastes of the body and maintains the health of the hair.\nPrakṛti\nPrakṛti is the discrete phenotype of an individual based on physical, psychological, physiological and\nbehavioural traits, and independent of social, ethnic and geographical variables.\nviii"}

Pañcakarma includes\ntherapeutically induced emesis (vamana) and purgation (virecana); administration of medicines\nthrough the nasal route (nasya); enemas using a mixture of medicinal substances, predominantly\nmade up of herbal decoctions (āsthāpanavasti/āsthāpanabasti,1 kaṣāyavasti or nirūhavasti); and\nenemas using lipid-based Ayurveda medicines (anuvāsanavasti or snehavasti). These five procedures\nare classified as the main (pradhāna) procedures (karma) of pañcakarma.\nProcedures preceding the main procedure are classified as preparatory procedures (pūrva karma)\nand those following the main procedure as post-therapy procedures (paścāt karma).

This\npresented what professional experts and health regulators considered to be appropriate training\nprogrammes for Ayurveda practitioners.\nA standardized protocol for Ayurveda, against which its actual practice can be compared and\nevaluated, has been lacking, however. With the increasing use of Ayurveda in clinical settings\nworldwide, there is an urgent need to develop benchmarks for the practice of Ayurveda to ensure\nits safety, quality and effectiveness.\nAligned to its objectives, this document serves as a reference to national authorities to establish\nor strengthen regulatory standards to ensure qualified practice of Ayurveda and to assure patient\nsafety. It describes models of practice and the practice profile of providers, and provides consensus\nto practitioners, professional organizations, regulators, health system managers and patients on how\nthe services should be organized.\nThis document will join Benchmarks for the training of Ayurveda to form an integral part of the serial\nbenchmarks, targeting key modalities of traditional medicine intervention and contributing to the\nestablishment of a reference toolkit for countries.\nHow was this benchmark prepared?\nThis document followed the established methodology of WHO to develop benchmarks in traditional,\ncomplementary and integrative medicine. To substantiate the update, a desk review of available\ninformation on formal licensure and established national standards and guidelines to assure goodquality health-care delivery of Ayurveda was conducted. As part of this exercise, the existing training\nbenchmark document was also reviewed.\nData from 26 Member States, including the 16 that regulate Ayurveda practitioners, were reviewed.2\nInformation from Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Germany, Hungary,\nIndia, Italy, Malaysia, Mauritius, Nepal, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Serbia, Singapore, South\nAfrica, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland and the United States of America were examined. The information was collected from\nrelevant websites of ministries of the respective Member States, and from direct communication with\nofficials and experts associated with these Member States. We examined the relevant information on\nexisting benchmarks, legislation, national standards and guidelines available in these countries.\nFrom the information gathered, we did not find evidence of an existing benchmark covering the\nobjectives holistically. We found considerable diversity of the practice, its prevalence and acceptance\namong the Member States. It became clear that the WHO benchmarks document should take into\naccount this diversity and suggest regulations for practice, products and training, keeping in mind the\ndifferent levels of social acceptance, community awareness and uptake, and availability of resources\nfor practice across the Member States.\n2 WHO global report on traditional and complementary medicine 2019.

Using a combination of “safety, “quality” and “trial” along with\n“Ayurveda” presented more than 78 200 references. Owing to the broad nature of the enquiry, we\nfurther refined the search into two categories.\nOne category identified the publications related to “benchmarks”, “regulations”, “quality”, “practice”\nand “training”. Filtering out duplicates and those not specifically relevant to Ayurveda practice or\ntraining provided information on 884 publications. After studying their abstracts, this was narrowed\ndown to 151 publications to be read in detail. Of these, 35 highlighted the need for a practice\nbenchmark document for Ayurveda practice, and 61 for a benchmark document for Ayurveda training.\nA total of 63 and 113 publications, respectively, provided insights into the content requirements of\npractice and training benchmark documents. Fifty-six publications identified regulatory gaps and\nrequirements, and 68 provided inputs on quality requirements of Ayurveda practice or training.\nThe second category refined the information for “Ayurveda and safety” and identified 3781\npublications after exclusion of duplicates. The data were further cleaned using a combination of\n“medicine”, “drug” or “trial” as additional filters. This provided information on 1228 publications.\nAnother filtration added the terms “randomise/ze” or “safety” in the title or abstract of the\npublications. In this category, we identified and examined in detail 326 publications that were most\nrelevant to the practice and training benchmarks of Ayurveda.\nThe first draft of the document was prepared based on the information gathered and directions\nidentified through the desk review. As the basis for its development, the draft document used the\nexisting regulatory frameworks in Member States; standard practices and processes adopted in\nMember States to guarantee safe, good-quality practice of traditional medicine; traditional textbooks\nof Ayurveda; and relevant information from WHO and other publications.\nThe first draft was reviewed and revised by the working group meeting in September 2018. The 39\nexperts, from 19 countries across the 6 WHO regions, of the working group reviewed the document for\nappropriateness in terms of its WHO-mandated objectives and its veracity with respect to the evidence\nconsidered. The experts also brought in new perspectives based on the current practice of the system\nin different Member States and evidence from publications. The second draft of the document, which\nevolved through the discussions in the working group, was sent for extensive international peer review.\nA total of 87 experts from 27 countries covering all 6 WHO regions contributed to the peer review.\nThey represented the range of expertise deemed essential in the development of the benchmarks\nand provided more than 3507 concrete suggestions encompassing every aspect of the document,\nfrom overall structural arrangement to specialized technical issues. The peer review provided\nperspectives from Australia, Bangladesh, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Malaysia, Mauritius, Nepal,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Oman, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, the\nUnited Arab Emirates and United States of America based on respective national regulations and\nexisting protocols. This valuable feedback supported the evolution of the second draft to the third\ndraft, which was then readied for further review at the expert consultation meeting.\nThe expert consultation meeting conducted in November 2019 aimed to conclude the consulting process\nby inviting selected experts to finalize the document. A total of 49 experts from 22 countries across the\n6 WHO regions joined the consultation and contributed to the development of the fourth draft.

It encompasses the physical, psychological,\nspiritual, social and subtle dimensions of life, and the dynamic concepts of well-being, promotion of\nhealth, and prevention and management of diseases.\nDocumented history of Ayurveda from the Indian subcontinent dates back 3500 years, and the\nreferences therein suggest the oral tradition of Ayurveda is even older.\nAs a system of health care and medicine, Ayurveda reflects time-tested knowledge and applied\naspects of health and illness during the human lifespan. It encompasses the scope of ensuring optimal\nlongevity and quality of life.\nThe current form of Ayurveda is the result of inferences and logical conclusions drawn from\nfundamental concepts, practical experiences, continuous direct observations, experimental\ninterventions and continual advancements with evidence-based inputs.\nOwing to its recognition as a comprehensive system of traditional medicine for providing holistic\nhealth care, there has been a resurgence of demand for Ayurveda practice, practitioners and products\nin many Member States, and its use is spreading to new regions and populations.\nAyurveda is rooted in two basic doctrines (siddhānta). The doctrine of pañca-mahābhūta postulates\nthat the manifestation of the entire physical universe, including the human body, is made possible by\nthe combined attributes of the five basic elements (pañca-mahābhūta): space (ākāśa), which allows\nroom for materials to exist; gaseous state (vāyu), which is the basis for motion; heat (agni), which\nallows energy exchange; liquid state (āpa), which allows materials to bond together; and solid state\n(pṛthvī), which allows materials to have mass.\nThe doctrine of tridoṣa postulates there are three doṣa (vāta, pitta, kapha), which maintain functional\nbalance in the body. Doṣa are biological factors formed as a result of synchronized interplay among\nthe pañca-mahābhūta (five basic elements) within a living system. Vāta is the doṣa that maintains\nfunctional balance through the processes of motion; pitta through the processes of transformation;\nand kapha through the processes of cumulation. The doṣa evolve through the processes of life and\nsimultaneously influence its course. They are embodied in different dhātu (structural elements of\nthe body) and metabolic products in a living system. The robustness of their functions maintains the\nnormal physiology of the body. Disturbance to their function is the basis for disease.\nThe basic approach of Ayurveda towards health and disease is holistic. It takes into consideration\nthe person’s body–mind constitution, behaviour, lifestyle and interaction with the environment. In\nAyurveda, the statuses of health and disease are attributed respectively to the balance and imbalance\nof doṣa, the digestive and metabolic processes (agni), the functional integrity of dhātu (structural\nelements of the body), the process of eliminating mala (excretable materials), and the harmonious\ncoordination of the body (śārīra), senses (indriya), mind (manas) and consciousness (ātmā).\nClinical practice of Ayurveda is aimed at promotion and maintenance of health, prevention of diseases\nand treatment of diseases, with the eventual objective to sustain or restore the natural harmonious\nbalance in the body–senses–mind–consciousness system.\nIn general, Ayurveda clinical practice (cikitsā) advocates three approaches – bio-cleansing therapy\n(saṃśodhana or śodhana), pacifying therapy (saṃśamana or śamana), and preventive interventions\n(nidānaparivarjana).\n1"}

These\nspecialties describe in detail the principles and methods of diagnosis and treatment in the clinical\ndomains of internal medicine (kaya-cikitsā); obstetrics and maternal, neonatal and paediatric health\n(kaumārabhṛtya); mental illness and diseases due to external influences invisible to naked eye (grahacikitsā); diseases of the head and neck (śālākya-tantra); diseases requiring surgical or parasurgical\ninterventions (śalya-tantra); diseases due to external toxins (agada-tantra); geriatrics and regenerative\nmedicine (rasāyana-cikitsā); and reproductive and sexual health (vaajeekarna-cikitsā).\nAccording to the classical texts of Ayurveda, successful clinical practice is built on four pillars (cikitsā\ncatuṣpāda):\n the Ayurveda practitioner (bhiṣak/vaidya);\n therapeutic tools (dravya), including medicines (auṣadha) and medical equipment and\ninstruments (upakaraṇa);\n paramedical and other support staff (upasthāta or paricāraka);\n the patient (rogi).\nThe success or failure of clinical practice depends on the qualities of each of these four pillars. Specific\nattributes for each of the four pillars are also described:\n The Ayurveda practitioner (bhiṣak) should be skilful, wise, clever, diligent, prompt, alert,\nexperienced and hygienic, with a thorough textual knowledge and contextual intelligence and\nwith high ethical and moral values.\n The medicines (auṣadha) should be suitable for use in different dosage forms, have multiple\nbeneficial effects, have all the claimed effectiveness, and be of good quality.\n Paramedical and other support staff (paricāraka) should be compassionate, hygienic, skilful,\nwise, clever, diligent, prompt, alert and intelligent.\n The patient (rogi) should be supported with sufficient resources to afford the treatment, have\nconfidence in the treating physician, comply with the treating physician’s clinical advice and\ninstructions, be able to communicate, and have a balanced mind and attitude.\nThe science of Ayurveda is based on universal principles and values that find their appropriate\nexpression with respect to place (deśa) and time (kāla). The contemporary form of clinical Ayurveda\npractice has multiple variants and peculiarities that vary from country to country, region to region,\npractitioner to practitioner and specialty to specialty.\nIn the twentieth century, education and practice of Ayurveda spread globally. Ayurveda is now\nregulated and practised to varying extents by Member States in all WHO regions. The WHO global\nreport on traditional and complementary medicine 2019 records that in 2012, Ayurveda was practised\nin 93 Member States, 32 Member States acknowledged the presence of Ayurveda providers practising\nin their country, 16 Member States had frameworks to regulate Ayurveda practitioners, and 5 Member\nStates had health insurance coverage for Ayurveda practices (1).\nAyurveda is the predominant traditional medicine system in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.\nThese countries train university-qualified Ayurveda practitioners, who are licensed to undertake\nclinical practice and research and are extensively involved in delivery of public health care.\nThere is much diversity in the training and practice of Ayurveda, outside the Indian subcontinent.\nThere is a need for guiding principles and norms for coherent, streamlined practice of Ayurveda,\nwhich will help to define the attributes of Ayurveda practitioners and requirements in health-care\nfacilities for general and specialty practice. There is also a need to bring uniformity in training and\npractice of Ayurveda to ensure its safe and effective use in Member States.\n2"}

These two objectives are not exclusive to each other and frequently overlap in\npractice. Treatment goals are achieved through interventions that have a logical causal effect on\nthe outcome.\nAyurveda practice should aim to achieve and promote health (svāsthya) and prevent diseases\nthrough the use of appropriate Ayurveda interventions. These interventions include daily regimens\n(dina-caryā), seasonal regimens (ߣtu-caryā) and appropriate self-, interpersonal and social conduct\n(sadvṛtta). Ayurveda medicines (auṣadha), pañcakarma and rejuvenating and regenerative Ayurveda\ninterventions, behaviours and conduct (rasāyana) are also used to maintain and promote health.\nIt is important for Ayurveda practitioners to study, analyse and understand a disease before\nintervening to correct it and restore health. This process includes understanding the cause of the\ndisease (nidāna), distinguishing its early (prodromal) signs and symptoms (pūrvarūpa), recognizing\nits full-blown spectrum of manifestation (rūpa), and understanding the paths by which the causative\nfactor has affected and altered the body to result in disease (pathology, saṃprāpti).\nSometimes it is necessary to observe the minute positive and negative responses of the patient\nto specific treatment interventions (upaśaya and anupaśaya) to deduct the accurate pathology\n(saṃprāpti) of the disease.\nIn general, a disease is understood by its cause and the signs and symptoms it manifests (vyādhi).\nBroadly, the pathology of a disease is understood as the dimensions of its effect on the doṣa (biological\nfactors that maintain functional balance), the functional integrity of the dhātu (structural elements\nof the body), and the process of eliminating the mala (excretable materials) – the triad of the body\nfunctions (generally termed the doṣa basis of the disease).\nWhen managing a patient, the Ayurveda practitioner should plan interventions to restore health after\nunderstanding the disease correctly. Based on the stage of the pathology (saṃprāpti), the objective\nof the intervention may be to purge the vitiated doṣa (doṣa śodhana) or to pacify the vitiated doṣa\n(doṣa śamana) to its original state. Depending on the cause, location, type and extent of suffering\ncaused by the disease, or the expected individualized prognosis, the objective of the interventions\nmay also be to disassociate the patient from the causative factors of the disease (nidānaparivarjana)\nand to manage the signs and symptoms (vyādhi śamana). These two approaches are not exclusive\nto each other and are often administered together.\nThe methods of intervention adopted to achieve these objectives are internal medicines\n(antaḥparimārjanaṃ), external medicines (bahiḥparimārjanam) and surgical or parasurgical methods\n(śastra praṇidhānam) achieved through the use of surgical instruments.\nPreventive interventions (nidānaparivarjana) may also fall under the broad category of purging or\npacifying the doṣa. Therefore, treatment methods are generally classified under interventions for\npurging the doṣa (doṣa śodhana) or for pacifying the doṣa (doṣa śamana).\n17"}

An intervention used to physically expel or remove the cause of suffering\nor disease is a cleaning procedure (śodhana). Cleaning wounds, washing the eyes, vaginal douches,\ngargles, emesis and enemas are examples of cleaning processes.\nEmesis (vamana) is the cleaning procedure used to expel disease-causing material from the stomach\nand upper part of the body, including the respiratory organs and tracts. Purgation (virecana) is the\ncleaning procedure used to expel disease-causing material from the intestines and lower part of the\nbody, such as with the use of enemas (vasti).\nAdministration of medicines through the nose (nasya) is the cleaning procedure used to expel diseasecausing materials from the nasopharynx and head.\nBloodletting (raktamokṣaṇa) is the cleaning procedure used to facilitate the removal of blood of\nabnormal quantity or quality, which can cause disease.\n5.1 Pañcakarma\nPañcakarma is a combination of two Sanskrit words – pañca meaning “five”, and karma meaning\n“work, action or procedure”. Pañcakarma refers to the five therapeutic methodologies that prepare\nand expel the vitiated doṣa and mala and then re-establish normal metabolism.\nPañcakarma includes therapeutically induced emesis (vamana) and purgation (virecana),\nadministration of medicines through the nose (nasya), use of enemas with a mixture of medicinal\nsubstances (predominantly made up of herbal decoctions – āsthāpanavasti, kaṣāyavasti or nirūhavasti),\nand use of enemas with lipid-based Ayurveda medicines (anuvāsanavasti or snehavasti).\nThese five procedures are classified as the main (pradhāna) procedures (karma) of pañcakarma.\nThe procedures preceding the main procedure are classified as preparatory procedures (pūrva karma),\nand those following the main procedure are classified as post-therapy procedures (paścāt karma).\nThe preparatory procedures and the post-therapy procedures are also part of the processes denoted\nby the broad term pañcakarma.\nAlthough the doṣa (biological factors that maintain functional balance) are spread all over the body,\nthe main kapha organs are in the chest, the pitta organs in the umbilical area, and the vāta organs in\nthe lower part of the intestine where the digestive process is completed. To regulate a doṣa, carefully\nplanned processes are undertaken, specifically focused on the organs in these parts of the body.\nExcessive kapha may be reduced by expelling it from the region of the chest through the upper\ngastrointestinal tract, the nasopharynx and the mouth. This is done by inducing medical emesis\n(vamana) using carefully selected medicines.\nExcessive pitta may be reduced by expelling it from the organs in the umbilical region through the\nintestines, rectum and anus. This is done by inducing medical purgation (virecana).\nFor emesis and purgation, it is essential that the vitiated kapha or pitta physically moves from its seat\nof accumulation to the corresponding excretory channels for expulsion. This is achieved through\npreparatory procedures (pūrva karma) involving administration of lipid-based medicines in titrated\nquantities and maintaining the person in an environment with controlled air, temperature, food\nand water for a specific period of time to pharmaceutically achieve the extrusion of the vitiated/\nexcess doṣa from the dhātu and ready it for physical displacement. This preparatory procedure is\ncalled snehapāna.\nThis is followed by the application of heat to the body to raise the temperature in a controlled manner\nthat results in controlled sweating (svedana). Different types of sweating procedures are used to\nadminister a variety of heat (e.g. dry, wet) and focus on different parts of the body or the body as a\nwhole. The process of sweating mobilizes the vitiated doṣa to the corresponding excretory channels.\n18"}

To overcome\nthis, gastrointestinal health must be built back systematically through controlled diet and activities\nof life. This post-therapy process (paścāt karma) is called saṃsarjana.\nVitiated doṣa accumulated in the head and neck region can be expelled through the nasopharyngeal,\nnasal and oral routes. This is achieved by administration of specific medicines through the nose (nasya).\nExcessive vāta is regulated using a medicated enema (vasti). Medicated enemas include a mixture\nof medicinal substances predominantly made up of herbal decoctions (āsthāpanavasti, kaṣāyavasti\nor nirūhavasti) or lipid-based Ayurveda medicines (anuvāsanavasti or snehavasti). Appropriate and\ncontrolled drastic reduction (śodhana) of vāta is achieved through the judicious use of enemas. Since\nthe enema acts on the seat of vāta directly, and there is a natural exit for the contents of the enema,\nit is not always essential to undertake elaborate preparatory or post-therapy procedures.\n5.2 Pacifying therapies (śamana)\nMost of the methods adopted in preparatory (pūrva karma) and post-therapy (paścāt karma)\nprocedures are also independent pacifying therapies and interventions (śamana), with specific and\nindependent therapeutic endpoints.\nIf the doṣa is not extensively vitiated, or the disease is mild and with less chance of progression and\ncomplications, or the patient’s health condition is not suitable for cleansing therapies (śodhana),\npacifying therapies are used.\nRegular clinical practice of Ayurveda aimed at day-to-day disease management mostly uses pacifying\nmethods (śamana). Pacifying therapies also use internal and external interventions.\nIn pacifying therapies, interventions are designed and administered to correct metabolism. This\nincludes interventions for improving the digestive process (jaṭharāgni), metabolic functions (agni),\nfunctional integrity of the dhātu (structural elements of the body), tissue metabolism (dhātu-agni)\nand the processes of elimination of mala (excretable materials). The process is initiated by controlling\nand reducing the external inputs (laṅghana) to reduce the complexity of the metabolic imbalance.\nIn a healthy person, mild doṣa imbalances can be managed through diet control (medically advised\nfasting and thirst, kṣut and pipāsā) or by increasing the natural metabolic process of the body through\nphysical exercise or exposure to sunlight or wind. These can be further supported by methods that\nenhance the extent of reach of the metabolic process to several layers of the metabolic process\n(dīpana) and by strengthening the metabolic process itself to support the digestion of metabolites\nresistant to normal digestive processes (pācana).\nA variety of pacifying interventions are used when treating diseases with more intense disturbances\nof the doṣa. These include internal medicines; interventions administered through the nose (nasya)\nand the rectum (vasti); fumigation (dhūmana); external therapies, such as sweating induced through\napplication of heat (svedana), local application of medicines, and different types of massage\n(abhyaṅga); and mind–body techniques, including yoga and meditation.\nPacifying therapies settle the vitiated doṣa and prevent their increase. Pacifying therapy methods are\nalso used to manage the signs and symptoms of disease (vyādhiśamana).\nSome interventions are classified as both cleansing (śodhana) and pacifying (śamana) procedures,\ndepending on the intended purpose of the intervention, the ingredients and dose of the medicines\nused, and the method of application.\nThe effect of an intervention depends on the properties and qualities of the interventions or\nmaterials used.

Care and precautions must\nbe taken when preparing medicines for this purpose. The outcome of Ayurveda interventions mainly\ndepends on the use of appropriate medicines in optimal doses to ensure desired results without\nuntoward effects.\nEach Ayurveda intervention has specific indications, contraindications, operative procedures, “do’s\nand don’ts” and outcome indicators that determine its optimal, insufficient or excessive effects,\npossible complications and remedial measures.\nA list of commonly used Ayurveda health interventions in the category of Ayurveda therapies is\nprovided in Annex 6.\n5.3 Promotion of health and prevention and management of diseases\nAyurveda interventions for the promotion of health focus on preserving and improving health\n(svāsthya). Interventions focus on improving the health-related knowledge of individuals in a\ncommunity and support individualized behavioural actions by taking into consideration the routine\nand daily life of the person and seasonal and environmental factors.\nAyurveda interventions for the promotion of health involve dissemination of proper knowledge related\nto health preservation and administration of timely and appropriate action based on Ayurvedic advice\non daily routines (dinacaryā), seasonal regimens (ṛtu-caryā) and appropriate conduct (sadvṛtta). This\nmakes use of methods such as preventive interventions (nidānaparivarjana), pacifying interventions\n(śamana), cleansing interventions (śodhana) and pañcakarma, as appropriate.\nAlthough Ayurveda interventions are most beneficial as individualized therapies, they can be used to\nsupport the requirements of the seven categories of humans comprising the population, according\nto the Ayurvedic concept of prakṛti (vāta, pitta, kapha, vāta-pitta, vāta-kapha, kapha-pitta and vātapitta-kapha), and may be administered as community-level Ayurveda interventions.\nPrakṛti is defined as “the discrete phenotype of an individual and it is determined based on physical,\npsychological, physiological and behavioral traits, and independent of social, ethnic and geographical\nvariables. Though all three doṣa exist in every human being, in most cases one is dominant based on\nwhich an individual’s prakṛti is determined” (3).\nFurther subcategorization of interventions is possible considering the environment (deśa), age (vayaḥ),\nspecial conditions of health such as pregnancy and old age, and existing or predisposition to chronic\ndiseases.\nAt the individual level, Ayurveda interventions may be further finetuned based on the increasing\ngranularity of the information available. Interventions or intervention protocols may be tailormade\nby taking into consideration the season; the person’s place of birth and residence; the diet, nutrition\nand quantity of food consumed (mātrā); sleep; sexual health; regularity of physical activity; relative\npredominance and strength (sāra) of dhātu (structural elements of the body); robustness of the\nmetabolism (agni); process of eliminating mala (excretable materials); management of natural urges\n(vega); adaptation owing to regular use of or continuous exposure to materials or environment\n(sātmya), or maladaptation to materials or environment despite continuous exposure (asātmya);\nregularity of use of improper combinations of food causing food–food interactions (viruddhāhāra);\nmental health, mental occupation and addictive habits; ease in succumbing to or recovering from\ninfectious or seasonal diseases; and family history of hereditary diseases.\nSeasonal cleansing procedures (śodhana) performed in healthy people to eliminate vitiated doṣa that\nwould otherwise cause seasonal diseases owing to their accumulation is an example of a preventive\n20"}

Components of Ayurveda health\ninterventions\nA health intervention is “an act performed for, with or on behalf of a person or population whose\npurpose is to assess, improve, maintain, promote or modify health, functioning or health conditions”,\nas defined by the World Health Organization in the International Classification of Health Interventions.\nConsultation is the process by which a practitioner interacts with a person for health-related needs,\nand that facilitates appropriate communication, clinical examination, diagnosis, and prescription of\nsuitable clinical advice, procedures and remedies.\nAyurveda medicine-based interventions involve interventions using Ayurveda medicinal products\nadministered internally (through the oral, nasal, conjunctival, anorectal, vaginal, vesical or uterine\nroutes) or externally (through the extradermal or transdermal routes). Any Ayurveda medicine-based\nintervention other than oral administration implies Ayurveda therapy according to the standard\noperating procedure of the therapy being administered.\nAyurveda therapies are procedure-based interventions that involve manual therapies, heat-based\ntherapies, pañcakarma, and surgical (śastra karma) and parasurgical (anuśastra karma) interventions.\nThey often use Ayurveda medicines, diet-based therapies, nutritional therapy, and interventions such\nas yoga and other mental, spiritual and mind–body therapies. Ayurveda therapies also use Ayurveda\nmedicines as part of the procedure and administer them through the mouth, nose, conjunctiva, anal\ncanal, vagina, urinary bladder, uterus, or extradermal or transdermal routes, according to the standard\noperating procedure of the therapy being administered.\nAyurveda hospitalization refers to the act of admitting a person to an Ayurveda medical care facility\nto administer Ayurveda health interventions for disease management, disease prevention or health\npromotion. Two kinds of hospitalization are possible in Ayurveda practice: daycare and inpatient\ncare. In daycare, the patient is admitted for a period between the morning and the evening and is\ndischarged on the same day. In inpatient care, the patient is managed at the facility overnight and\nsometimes for several days.\nAyurveda pharmacy services in this document relate to activities undertaken to collect, prepare, store\nand dispense Ayurveda health products.

The eight health\nprofessions regulated by Section 3 of the Individual Health Care Professions Act are dentist, doctor,\nhealth-care psychologist, midwife, nurse, pharmacist, physiotherapist and psychotherapist. The new\nregistration and title protection of these professions started on 1 December 1997. Performance of\nsuch a procedure by an unauthorized practitioner is a criminal offence. The procedures specified are\nartificial insemination (including vasti), cardioversion, catheterizations and endoscopies, defibrillation,\nelectroconvulsive therapy, general anaesthetics, lithotripsy, obstetric procedures, procedures involving\nthe use of radioactive substances and ionising radiation, punctures and injections, and surgical\nprocedures.\nA new health insurance system was introduced in 2006. Complementary and alternative medicine\ntreatments are not covered by basic health insurance, but health insurers cover alternative treatment\nas either additional “free” benefits or covered by complementary voluntary health insurance.\nAyurveda treatments and fees for consultation are partially covered by private insurance companies.\nThe prerequisite for such reimbursement is that the Ayurveda practitioner needs to be a registered\nmember of a professional body. If Ayurveda treatment is offered by a Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine\nand Surgery or an Ayurveda practitioner educated on accredited institutes in the Netherlands and\nin accordance with WHO guidelines for Ayurveda education, most health insurers will reimburse all\nor part of the treatment or consultation under the supplementary package.
